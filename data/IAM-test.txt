168,c04-110-00 Become a success with a disc and hey presto! You're a star.... Rolly sings with
168,c04-110-01 assuredness "Bella Bella Marie" (Parlophone), a lively song that changes tempo mid-way.
168,c04-110-02 I don't think he will storm the charts with this one, but it's a good start.
168,c04-110-03 CHRIS CHARLES, 39, who lives in Stockton-on-Tees, is an accountant.
168,c04-116-00 He is also a director of a couple of garages. And he finds time as well to be a lyric
168,c04-116-01 writer. He writes with Tolchard Evans, composer of "Lady of Spain" and other big hits.
168,c04-116-02 Tolch, as he is known in Tin Pan Alley, likes songs with a month in the title. He wrote
168,c04-116-03 "My September Love," the big David Whitfield hit of 1956.
169,c04-134-00 The numbers include "Scotland the Brave," "Men of Harlech,"
169,c04-134-01 "McNamara's Band," "Greensleeves" and "English Rose."
169,c04-134-02 Fay Compton stars in "No Hiding Place" (I T V, 9.35 p.m.).
169,c04-134-03 She plays the possessive mother of a man whose hobby revolves
169,c04-134-04 round a doll's house.
169,c04-134-05 THREE people will be hypnotised in tonight's "Lifeline"
169,c04-134-06 (B B C, 10.15).
169,c04-139-00 They will be asked to comment on the design of everyday articles
169,c04-139-01 such as a chair and a motor-car. The idea is to see what happens when
169,c04-139-02 parts of the mind not normally available without hypnosis are used.
169,c04-139-03 I T V have postponed Malcolm Muggeridge's "Appointment with
169,c04-139-04 playwright Arnold Wesker." Instead, Muggeridge's appointment
169,c04-139-05 will be with Sir Roy Welensky the Premier of the Federation
169,c04-139-06 of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (10.30 p.m.).
170,c04-144-00 Say Granada T V, the producers: "We decided to make
170,c04-144-01 the switch because of the topicality of African
170,c04-144-02 affairs. The Wesker interview will be seen at a later
170,c04-144-03 date." ACTOR Tom Courtenay was an outstanding
170,c04-144-04 success last night in I T V's "Private Potter," his
170,c04-144-05 first big T V part. The play was a brilliantly-written
170,c04-144-06 essay on soldiering which stated that a fighting
170,c04-144-07 man could only be regarded as a machine.
170,c04-150-00 Potter screamed during an action, and was arrested. He
170,c04-150-01 claimed he had seen a vision of God - only the padre and his
170,c04-150-02 C O believed him. Courtenay played the part with a gawky,
170,c04-150-03 Northern defiance. The cameras played continuously on his
170,c04-150-04 craggy face, and obstinate, baffled eyes. They stripped
170,c04-150-05 him of his ugly battle-dress, to leave him for
170,c04-150-06 what he was - Potter, a frightened boy who had a
170,c04-150-07 vision.
172,c04-165-00 The film replaced "What's My Line?" and "Be My
172,c04-165-01 Guest" programmes because of an electricians'
172,c04-165-02 strike. It showed Britain today through the eyes
172,c04-165-03 of an American T V reporter, Eric Sevareid, and
172,c04-165-04 British personalities. Among them - Professor
172,c04-165-05 Dennis Brogan, Shelagh Delaney, and Alan Sillitoe.
172,c04-165-06 The film covered a wide aspect of the British
172,c04-165-07 scene, ranging from pubs, the Eton wall game,
172,c04-165-08 to the European Common Market.
172,c04-170-00 Shelagh Delaney and Alan Sillitoe attacked
172,c04-170-01 education. It was left to reporter Sevareid
172,c04-170-02 to make the strongest criticisms. He said
172,c04-170-03 that in the race of the modern nations,
172,c04-170-04 Britain was slipping behind....
173,c06-011-00 ALSO present is a London journalist who
173,c06-011-01 arrived two hours earlier by appointment
173,c06-011-02 to talk to the author of Borstal Boy and
173,c06-011-03 The Hostage about his new work, if any,
173,c06-011-04 and who is now being pluckily convivial
173,c06-011-05 to fight off the frustration. The telephone
173,c06-011-06 has rung a couple of times, calls from
173,c06-011-07 other chums sniffing the wind and
173,c06-011-08 offering to drop by for a chat.
175,d01-016-00 The second said that the problems which arise from the comparisons with
175,d01-016-01 the Synoptics can be reasonably solved by paying due regard to the time and
175,d01-016-02 plan and to the different public for which, or against which, the author wrote.
175,d01-016-03 The third article excluded any allegorical interpretation of the Gospel.
175,d01-019-00 There is a whole group of theories which attempt to explain the problems of the
175,d01-019-01 Fourth Gospel by explanations based on assumed textual dislocations. The
175,d01-019-02 present state of the Gospel is the result of an accident-prone history. The
175,d01-019-03 original was written on a roll, or codex, which fell into disorder or was
175,d01-019-04 accidentally damaged. An editor, who was not the author, made what he
175,d01-019-05 could of the chaos by placing the fragments, or sheets, or pages, in order.
177,d01-049-00 The one real weakness of the Commentator's
177,d01-049-01 case is that, in common with all his colleagues,
177,d01-049-02 he has not, until now, been able to exhibit exactly
177,d01-049-03 how this enlargement was effected nor has he
177,d01-049-04 been able to explain the textual movements by
177,d01-049-05 showing that such changes are part of a
177,d01-049-06 simple and coherent plan. To understand how
177,d01-049-07 this is possible it is necessary to examine the
177,d01-049-08 text of the Gospel.
177,d01-052-00 THE Fourth Gospel was almost certainly
177,d01-052-01 written in Greek. A modern text of the
177,d01-052-02 Gospel represents the work of generations of
177,d01-052-03 scholars who have compared the many manu-
177,d01-052-04 scripts of John and worked out the version
177,d01-052-05 which is most likely to have been the original
177,d01-052-06 wording. It is not possible to establish any one
177,d01-052-07 text with absolute precision.
179,d01-080-00 The bar was the commonest marking, but others
179,d01-080-01 were also used. Dots sometimes served in place of the
179,d01-080-02 bar, and there are cases where spacing is used as
179,d01-080-03 it is now used to mark a paragraph ending. Frequently
179,d01-080-04 paragraphos markings were omitted. C. H. Roberts is of
179,d01-080-05 the opinion that in the original of the Fourth Gospel
179,d01-080-06 some markings would be used, although which, it is
179,d01-080-07 impossible to say.
179,d01-085-00 Professor E. G. Turner is inclined to take the view that
179,d01-085-01 the original of the Gospel would be unmarked. The
179,d01-085-02 original of the Gospel, whether written on a roll or codex,
179,d01-085-03 whether paragraphed or not, would be laid out in
179,d01-085-04 columns. This is the invariable practice of ancient
179,d01-085-05 manuscripts. A common size of column would hold
179,d01-085-06 about one third of a page of Souter's print.
180,d01-098-00 The edge of this sheet was attached to a wooden dowel
180,d01-098-01 and the sheet wound round this central pin. The roll made
180,d01-098-02 a simple and serviceable book. It was robust - the number
180,d01-098-03 which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of
180,d01-098-04 this - and it was easily stored. It had two disadvantages. It
180,d01-098-05 was generally a single-sided form of book, and it was not
180,d01-098-06 an easy form of book in which to find a
180,d01-098-07 reference.
180,d01-104-00 This last objection might have had some weight in
180,d01-104-01 ecclesiastical circles. In his Natural History, 13.11-12,
180,d01-104-02 the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making.
180,d01-104-03 As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which
180,d01-104-04 overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79, his
180,d01-104-05 information is contemporaneous with the New Testament.
180,d01-104-06 The other form of book was the codex. In this the
180,d01-104-07 sheets were bound together down one edge much as
180,d01-104-08 they are in modern books.
181,d01-118-00 Against these advantages the codex was fragile and
181,d01-118-01 might be bulky. It is sometimes possible to tell
181,d01-118-02 whether or not a particular text was written on
181,d01-118-03 a roll or a codex. Rolls were prepared for
181,d01-118-04 writing, but any papyrus left unused at the
181,d01-118-05 end could be cut off. If the text was longer than
181,d01-118-06 the roll, a sheet could easily be glued on.
181,d01-123-00 The verso of the roll was blank, and one
181,d01-123-01 cannot think of an author, Mark for example,
181,d01-123-02 sending out his Gospel lacking the ending,
181,d01-123-03 while one whole side of his roll was unused.
181,d01-123-04 The codex form was not so accommodating. Even
181,d01-123-05 in the case of the single-sheet quire, an extra
181,d01-123-06 sheet glued on might have to be gummed on
181,d01-123-07 over the binding, or the whole codex rebound.
183,d03-117-00 A natural transition from gardens and
183,d03-117-01 orchards to the vital question of water
183,d03-117-02 supply. The pools are probably natural springs
183,d03-117-03 enlarged to become reservoirs or cisterns in
183,d03-117-04 the rock. King Mesha of Moab boasts of their
183,d03-117-05 construction in lines 9, 23-25 of the Moabite Stone,
183,d03-117-06 which read: And I built Baal-meon and made
183,d03-117-07 in it the reservoir... and I made both the
183,d03-117-08 reservoirs for water inside the town.
185,d04-012-00 The word Shamir was used as a
185,d04-012-01 personal name (Git. 68a). The Hebrew
185,d04-012-02 word "SHAMIR" means guarded or preser-
185,d04-012-03 ved. Therefore, the real man, who
185,d04-012-04 regards himself as insignificant, as the
185,d04-012-05 prayer says: "What am I? A worm", he
185,d04-012-06 is the Shamir and such a man fulfils
185,d04-012-07 the Shmah, loves the Lord God with
185,d04-012-08 all his heart, and with all his soul and
185,d04-012-09 with all his might and studies the
185,d04-012-10 word of God.
185,d04-016-00 This man is the worm, the creature that
185,d04-016-01 cuts and polishes Altar-Stones. Such
185,d04-016-02 a man is the Shamir that guards him-
185,d04-016-03 self against all the irrelevant pleasures.
185,d04-016-04 Such a Shamir possesses the real acid
185,d04-016-05 to mould our character, to melt our
185,d04-016-06 heart of stone. This Shamir helps
185,d04-016-07 us earthly creatures to build an Altar
185,d04-016-08 for God to come nearer to God.
186,d04-021-00 The action of the Shamir writes books and their
186,d04-021-01 books are readable. This Shamir is indeed a rare
186,d04-021-02 diamond that incises the hardest rock, the hardest
186,d04-021-03 facts. And these creatures existed from the
186,d04-021-04 beginning. It is "the stone, which the builders
186,d04-021-05 refused, but it is to become the head-stone
186,d04-021-06 of the corner". (Ps. 118, 22.) And the stone shall
186,d04-021-07 tell!
186,d04-028-00 "For the stone shall cry out of the wall", like
186,d04-028-01 Baalam's ass, "and the purlin of timber shall
186,d04-028-02 creak in answer" "if the roof of our security is
186,d04-028-03 crushing our soul" (see Hab. 2, 10-11). And it is
186,d04-028-04 through the Shamir: "That the earth shall be
186,d04-028-05 filled with the knowledge of the Glory of the
186,d04-028-06 Lord, as the waters cover the sea." (Hab. 2, 14.)
187,d04-032-00 The Shamir's daily life writes the Decalogue,
187,d04-032-01 which is written on two plates, the hard facts
187,d04-032-02 of life, and all facts are "one". We have all
187,d04-032-03 come across human Shamirs and they leave
187,d04-032-04 a deep impression on our feelings and senses.
187,d04-032-05 They make us the Altar for God to emit
187,d04-032-06 the Light which can be read in every
187,d04-032-07 language. The Shamir is the "seventh" and
187,d04-032-08 most important creature, that was created on
187,d04-032-09 the eve of the Sabbath, to bring the
187,d04-032-10 Sabbath, real peace to the whole world.
187,d04-037-00 Then the whole earth will be His Altar. "And it
187,d04-037-01 shall come to pass, if 1ye shall 1hearken
187,d04-037-02 diligently unto my commandments, which I command
187,d04-037-03 you this day, to love the Lord your God, and to
187,d04-037-04 serve Him with all your heart and with all
187,d04-037-05 your soul." This may seem very good, but there
187,d04-037-06 is something deficient.
188,d04-047-00 Under such conditions without putting your
188,d04-047-01 mind together we cannot solve the further
188,d04-047-02 summons of destiny, to solve the economic
188,d04-047-03 problems. Hence says Rabbi Simeon ben
188,d04-047-04 Jochai (Tanis 6a) "if Israel does not fulfil
188,d04-047-05 the wish of the Lord, failing to serve the
188,d04-047-06 Lord God with all their visionary power,
188,d04-047-07 the work will have to be done by each
188,d04-047-08 individual".
189,d04-050-00 They will not work in union. If physical power, spiritual power
189,d04-050-01 and visionary power is not united, man will remain in his heart
189,d04-050-02 selfish and think only of one's personal advantage to
189,d04-050-03 gratify selfish aims, then each man will gather-in
189,d04-050-04 for himself only, instead of all to help to gather your
189,d04-050-05 corn, your wine and your oil.
188,d04-053-00 Freedom from want cannot be fulfilled nor
188,d04-053-01 freedom from fear, fear of starvation in the
188,d04-053-02 midst of plenty. Help will not be easily forth-
188,d04-053-03 coming for the people in need. They will
188,d04-053-04 think of the animals first (which is of course
188,d04-053-05 our duty). Of course the individual will
188,d04-053-06 eat and be full but: "Take heed to yourself,
188,d04-053-07 that your heart be not deceived, and 1ye turn
188,d04-053-08 aside, and serve other gods, and worship them",
188,d04-053-09 the yourself is thy greatest enemy, the self-
188,d04-053-10 seeking self.
190,d04-058-00 And you serve Mammon and God. And you cannot serve
190,d04-058-01 two masters, and you worship self-interest, isolating
190,d04-058-02 yourself, under such conditions the goods are your gods.
190,d04-058-03 "And then the Lord's wrath be kindled against you, and he
190,d04-058-04 shut up the heavens, that there is no rain, and that the land
190,d04-058-05 yield not her fruit and lest 1ye perish quickly from off the
190,d04-058-06 good land which the Lord 1giveth you."
190,d04-062-00 For without the vision to serve the Lord your God with all
190,d04-062-01 your heart and with all your soul and with all your might
190,d04-062-02 the problem of life cannot be solved. "Therefore shall 1ye lay
190,d04-062-03 up these my words in your heart and in your soul." The text
190,d04-062-04 adds and in your soul, searching your soul.
191,d04-066-00 And the sequence in the text is different than
191,d04-066-01 in the first part of the Shmah, we have first "and
191,d04-066-02 to bind them for a sign upon your hand, that
191,d04-066-03 they may be as frontlets between your eyes." First to
191,d04-066-04 bind them to have the vision and then "And 1ye
191,d04-066-05 shall teach them to your children." And as we have go-
191,d04-066-06 ne through the mill, we need not teach them
191,d04-066-07 to the children any more diligently and the
191,d04-066-08 children will grasp now what will befall
191,d04-066-09 them without visionary power.
194,d04-086-00 And the tsitsits had a message sealed inside the knots
194,d04-086-01 just as there is a message sealed in the four emblems which
194,d04-086-02 are used on Passover, to depict the "time of our freedom".
194,d04-086-03 And they are (1) Matzo; (2) Bitter Herbs; (3) Salt-water and
194,d04-086-04 Charauses (a kind of fruit mixture in likeness of the
194,d04-086-05 appearance of mortar); and (4) an attitude to lean
194,d04-086-06 back.
194,d04-089-00 (1) Matzos is deficient bread, (LECHEM ANJO in Hebrew),
194,d04-089-01 so are we deficient without spiritual knowledge, and to
194,d04-089-02 cure our mental incapacity we should be willing
194,d04-089-03 to learn. Education is always the most important task.
194,d04-089-04 Education gives: Freedom of Speech. (2) Bitter Herbs
194,d04-089-05 symbolises the bitterness that is hurled against us.
194,d04-089-06 We eat it. We accept it, to show we have self-control
194,d04-089-07 and that God dwells within us.
195,d04-096-00 Self-control gives us: Freedom to worship God. (3) Salt Water and Charauses:
195,d04-096-01 the salt-water at the Seder-Table represents the Covenant of the Torah
195,d04-096-02 (MELACH BRITH ELOHECHO in Hebrew, Salt is the covenant of 1thy God,
195,d04-096-03 Levit. 2, 13.) Salt preserves and we should have this salt in
195,d04-096-04 ourselves and have peace with one-another. And the sweet
195,d04-096-05 Mortar (the CHARAUSES in Hebrew) that binds all the "hard-
195,d04-096-06 facts" together and explains them, represents the Oral
195,d04-096-07 Tradition.
195,d04-101-00 We dip into both, at the Seder. And we want to understand
195,d04-101-01 more of the Torah and the Oral Tradition, our inheritance.
195,d04-101-02 Living the life of the Torah ("dipping-in") makes us
195,d04-101-03 meek: "But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall
195,d04-101-04 delight themselves in the abundance of Peace" (Psalm 37,
195,d04-101-05 11). That gives us freedom from want.
196,d04-111-00 (1) Matzo represents Peshat; (2) Moraur
196,d04-111-01 represents Remez; (3) Dipping-in represents
196,d04-111-02 Derush; (4) Leaning-back represents Saud.
196,d04-111-03 (This is the PARDUS.) Matzo represents
196,d04-111-04 the literal meaning of Pesach which
196,d04-111-05 is called: The Feast of Matzos. The
196,d04-111-06 Bitter-Herbs represent the spiritual
196,d04-111-07 principle and this gives us "a wink" (Remez)
196,d04-111-08 how to live and accept all the bitterness
196,d04-111-09 that is hurled against us. The Salt-water
196,d04-111-10 and the sweet Mortar in which we dip-in represents
196,d04-111-11 the richness of the Law and that we should
198,d04-125-00 And we answer, that the Lord our God gave us "four freedoms"
198,d04-125-01 without which Society cannot make progress. And we drink
198,d04-125-02 "four cups" to thank the Lord our God for the "four
198,d04-125-03 freedoms" which are Divine. There are four ways of
198,d04-125-04 redemption: (1) I will bring you out from under the
198,d04-125-05 burdens of Egypt. (2) I will rid you of their bondage.
198,d04-131-00 (3) I will redeem you. (4) I will take you to me for a
198,d04-131-01 people. (1) I will bring you out from under the
198,d04-131-02 burdens of Egypt: How was it that Israel was
198,d04-131-03 brought out from under the burdens of Egypt?
198,d04-131-04 Because, they kept the Passover and they were
198,d04-131-05 eating Matzos in Egypt and the "Feast of Matzos"
198,d04-131-06 was known even to Abraham and Lot.
199,d05-008-00 The new century opened with James 1 ascending
199,d05-008-01 the throne. He was quite prepared to be
199,d05-008-02 tolerant towards Rome though the Gunpowder Plot
199,d05-008-03 spoiled that. The Puritans had high hopes, for
199,d05-008-04 James had grown up in Presbyterian Scotland,
199,d05-008-05 but those hopes were dashed. True, a new Prayer
199,d05-008-06 Book was issued in 1604 but the Puritans
199,d05-008-07 derived little comfort from it.
200,d05-013-00 They objected to the word Absolution. So the phrase 'or
200,d05-013-01 the remission of sins' was added. But Absolution remained.
200,d05-013-02 They objected to the word Confirmation. So the phrase
200,d05-013-03 'or the laying on of hands upon children baptized and
200,d05-013-04 able to render an account of their faith according
200,d05-013-05 to the Catechism following' were added. But Confirmation
200,d05-013-06 remained. Other changes in the Book were equally
200,d05-013-07 minor except for the new section on the Sacraments
200,d05-013-08 added to the Catechism.
199,d05-021-00 This indicated how ephemeral in the Church had
199,d05-021-01 been the mood which produced the Black Rubric, for
199,d05-021-02 it says that 'the Body and Blood of Christ, which are
199,d05-021-03 verily and indeed taken and received by the
199,d05-021-04 faithful in the Lord's Supper.' It could hardly be more
199,d05-021-05 definite. It was at this time, too, that King James made
199,d05-021-06 himself immortal by becoming associated with
199,d05-021-07 a Bible translation - the Authorized Version
199,d05-021-08 (which was never actually authorized!).
199,d05-025-00 In that year Shakespeare had just turned
199,d05-025-01 forty and had written Hamlet two years
199,d05-025-02 before. Bacon was at work and Milton was
199,d05-025-03 just learning to read. James was followed by
199,d05-025-04 Charles, in whose reign came the Scottish
199,d05-025-05 Prayer Book in 1637. Significantly this made
199,d05-025-06 a deliberate return to the Book of 1549 and
199,d05-025-07 became the foster mother of some of the most
199,d05-025-08 important Prayer Books in the Anglican
199,d05-025-09 Communion.
199,d05-030-00 Forever associated with Charles is Archbishop Laud,
199,d05-030-01 now so much nobler a figure than former historians
199,d05-030-02 led us to believe. Laud was enthusiastically hated
199,d05-030-03 by Calvinists and Puritans, and the sentiment was
199,d05-030-04 mutual. But Laud was no Romanizer. One of his
199,d05-030-05 first public acts was a hard-hitting battle with
199,d05-030-06 the Jesuit, Fisher. But anyone who was friendly
199,d05-030-07 with James and Charles, the Puritans argued,
199,d05-030-08 was necessarily a menace.
201,d05-040-00 Or when he found cock-fighting going on in church?
201,d05-040-01 Laud made a positive approach. He set out to increase
201,d05-040-02 a sense of reverence. The Prayer Book was to be respected
201,d05-040-03 and so was the office of a bishop. Altars should be
201,d05-040-04 altars and not any broken down, transportable
201,d05-040-05 table which was handy for the most improbable uses.
203,d06-003-00 Even worse is to laugh. Tremendous damage may be done to a child
203,d06-003-01 by laughing at what are very real fears. As adults, we know
203,d06-003-02 that their fears are groundless, indeed to us they appear laughable,
203,d06-003-03 but to a child they are very real. Not that I am suggesting
203,d06-003-04 that children should be molly-coddled - they must be made
203,d06-003-05 to face their fears, to see through them and come out on the
203,d06-003-06 other side as victors.
173,d06-008-00 To ridicule them only pushes them farther
173,d06-008-01 into themselves, so that they become
173,d06-008-02 unable to speak about it to anybody and
173,d06-008-03 the seeds of any amount of trouble are sown,
173,d06-008-04 the harvest of which may still be being
173,d06-008-05 reaped at forty or fifty. Far better to
173,d06-008-06 agree with a child that a particular
173,d06-008-07 situation is frightening, and then to face
173,d06-008-08 it together until the child can see how
173,d06-008-09 unnecessary its fears were.
204,d06-011-00 Because situations which may contain
204,d06-011-01 all the elements of fear can arise suddenly,
204,d06-011-02 it is a good idea to condition a child
204,d06-011-03 to some extent against it. To keep a child
204,d06-011-04 of twelve or thirteen under the
204,d06-011-05 impression that nothing nasty ever
204,d06-011-06 happens is not merely dishonest, it
204,d06-011-07 is unwise. As I shall suggest in a
204,d06-011-08 later chapter there are some situations
204,d06-011-09 which occur less frequently than
173,d06-020-00 In Gethsemane He prayed that the cup
173,d06-020-01 should pass from Him. Jesus shows us
173,d06-020-02 the way to face life. To see all the latent
173,d06-020-03 frightening possibilities and yet by facing
173,d06-020-04 them and knowing God is with us and
173,d06-020-05 that, with Him, there is nothing that can
173,d06-020-06 finally defeat us. More than that, that God
173,d06-020-07 has something important to do with our
173,d06-020-08 lives and that the nearer we get to Him,
173,d06-020-09 the stronger we become.
205,d06-025-00 ...Today A wonderful thought In the
205,d06-025-01 dawn was given... And the thought
205,d06-025-02 Was this: That a secret plan Is hid in
205,d06-025-03 my hand; That my hand is big Big,
205,d06-025-04 Because of the plan That God, Who
205,d06-025-05 dwells in my hand, Knows this
205,d06-025-06 secret plan, Of the things He will
205,d06-025-07 do for the world Using my hand.
206,d06-027-00 Toyohiko Kagawa. Loving Saviour, who experienced
206,d06-027-01 all human emotion, and whose sensitive
206,d06-027-02 nature knows better than we do, what it is to
206,d06-027-03 be really afraid, help us to know that when
206,d06-027-04 we face life boldly, many of the shadows are
206,d06-027-05 seen to be allies and not enemies and that,
206,d06-027-06 come what may, we are never alone when
206,d06-027-07 we are with Thee.
207,d06-037-00 To others, the long hours of the night bring
207,d06-037-01 only a disturbed tossing and turning
207,d06-037-02 which causes them to wake feeling worse
207,d06-037-03 than when they went to bed. We may begin
207,d06-037-04 to understand this a little better when we
207,d06-037-05 realize that tiredness itself is largely in
207,d06-037-06 the mind. Very few people, under normal
207,d06-037-07 conditions, work themselves to a standstill.
208,d06-041-00 The mind tires first and conveys the impression
208,d06-041-01 of tiredness to the body. This can be proved by
208,d06-041-02 noting the effect of a new stimulus on some-
208,d06-041-03 body who feels thoroughly tired. Suppose
208,d06-041-04 a mother has news late at night that her
208,d06-041-05 child is in danger. She will undertake a
208,d06-041-06 journey which, an hour before, she would
208,d06-041-07 have declared impossible.
173,d06-046-00 Even more simply, test your own reactions
173,d06-046-01 to different situations. There are some which
173,d06-046-02 bring on an almost immediate feeling of
173,d06-046-03 tiredness - such as when your wife mentions
173,d06-046-04 the washing-up - while others, if they
173,d06-046-05 refer to something you like doing, bring a
173,d06-046-06 veritable surge of energy. Many a girl who
173,d06-046-07 is 'too tired to help mum' will later jump
173,d06-046-08 up with no apparent tiredness at all when
173,d06-046-09 her boy friend calls and go for a long walk.
206,d06-056-00 They drag themselves around and can become
206,d06-056-01 a burden to their families and their friends.
206,d06-056-02 Any mental confusion can cause this and
206,d06-056-03 the best way is probably to seek advice.
206,d06-056-04 As we are unable to cure our own bodies
206,d06-056-05 if the cause of our pain is too deep seated,
206,d06-056-06 so we are unable to cure our own minds,
206,d06-056-07 if the trouble is a complicated one
206,d06-056-08 involving careful and patient treatment.
208,d06-060-00 One of the greatest steps forward that has been
208,d06-060-01 made this century is the way in which illness
208,d06-060-02 of the mind is no longer feared or shunned,
208,d06-060-03 and is in fact no differently regarded than
208,d06-060-04 physical illness. There is, nevertheless, a
208,d06-060-05 great deal of tiredness which comes from
208,d06-060-06 no major complication but results from an
208,d06-060-07 inability to deal with life, especially under
208,d06-060-08 the diverse pattern which is the twentieth
208,d06-060-09 century.
173,d06-063-00 In the days when most people were born,
173,d06-063-01 lived and died within the boundaries of
173,d06-063-02 the village, it was not difficult for anybody
173,d06-063-03 to live a day at a time. Even those who
173,d06-063-04 held a high and responsible office lived in
173,d06-063-05 far greater simplicity than their successors.
173,d06-063-06 When news from the Continent took days,
173,d06-063-07 from America weeks, from the Far East,
173,d06-063-08 months, even a Prime Minister could go to
173,d06-063-09 sleep in blissful ignorance of what might
173,d06-063-10 be happening at the other end of England,
205,d06-067-00 In other ways, too, life for the ordinary
205,d06-067-01 individual has become so complex
205,d06-067-02 that it taxes the mind. Two hundred
205,d06-067-03 years ago, men lived and worked
205,d06-067-04 in one place, their lives were of one
205,d06-067-05 piece. Now a man may live twenty,
205,d06-067-06 thirty even sixty miles from his
205,d06-067-07 work. The only connexion is the
205,d06-067-08 pipeline of the railway on which they
205,d06-067-09 travel day by day.
207,d06-072-00 In many cases, their homes know little of
207,d06-072-01 their place of work and their associates at
207,d06-072-02 the office or works wonder what they
207,d06-072-03 are possibly like in the surroundings of their
207,d06-072-04 homes. It is easy, desperately easy, to lead
207,d06-072-05 a 'double' life without ever deliberately
207,d06-072-06 planning to do so or in fact being conscious
207,d06-072-07 of what is going on. It is easier to live life in
207,d06-072-08 compartments but over the years it builds up,
207,d06-072-09 and to do so inevitably builds up tensions which
207,d06-072-10 need to be handled correctly.
203,d06-076-00 Can we then frame some 'rules' which may enable us to live life
203,d06-076-01 as fully as possible, without having our energy sapped by un-
203,d06-076-02 necessary weariness. (a) Order makes for a decrease in tiredness.
203,d06-076-03 We have a saying 'My head will never save my feet'. Time
203,d06-076-04 after time we forget something and have to go back
203,d06-076-05 upstairs or down to the shops.
208,d06-086-00 The housewife would find life far less tiring
208,d06-086-01 if she made a list, followed a routine of work
208,d06-086-02 rather than getting from one thing to the next.
208,d06-086-03 The business man would find that he reached
208,d06-086-04 the end of the day with far less strain if
208,d06-086-05 he was a little more systematic. To drift
208,d06-086-06 aimlessly along is more wearying than any-
208,d06-086-07 thing else. If we would only sit down and
208,d06-086-08 write out all the necessary jobs waiting to
208,d06-086-09 be done and then work quietly through them,
208,d06-086-10 we would find life considerably less exhausting
206,d06-096-00 I am more than conscious of this. How anybody
206,d06-096-01 can go through the same routine day in and day
206,d06-096-02 out for forty years I find difficult to understand.
206,d06-096-03 A lot of it is inevitable so that industry and
206,d06-096-04 commerce may be kept going - though if ever
206,d06-096-05 it becomes possible to work out a system
206,d06-096-06 of 'staggered' hours it may do an immense
206,d06-096-07 amount of good over and above relieving
206,d06-096-08 the pressure on over-crowded trains.
207,d06-100-00 As it is, with so much of our life already
207,d06-100-01 in a predetermined groove, I would
207,d06-100-02 hardly like to add further to the dullness
207,d06-100-03 which it engenders. But I am not arguing
207,d06-100-04 for this. I know how much of a drag it can be
207,d06-100-05 and I was interested some little while
207,d06-100-06 ago to hear of a school who tried a six-
207,d06-100-07 day timetable.
205,d06-104-00 They only worked, of course, a five-
205,d06-104-01 day week so that in the first week
205,d06-104-02 Monday to Friday were days one
205,d06-104-03 to five of the timetable, the following
205,d06-104-04 Monday was day six and Tuesday
205,d06-104-05 started day one again and so on.
205,d06-104-06 By this means they avoided each
205,d06-104-07 week being the same with a pupil
205,d06-104-08 knowing exactly what the subject
205,d06-104-09 would be on Friday afternoon at
205,d06-104-10 3 p.m..
204,d06-107-00 It was a little complicated to work,
204,d06-107-01 of course, and there had to be a big
204,d06-107-02 notice in the entrance saying which
204,d06-107-03 day of the timetable it was - but
204,d06-107-04 it added immensely to the interest
204,d06-107-05 and kept everybody on their toes.
204,d06-107-06 To have order does not mean getting
204,d06-107-07 into a dull routine. I have great
204,d06-107-08 sympathy with the young wife
204,d06-107-09 who does not always want to do
204,d06-107-10 the washing on a Monday.
203,d06-111-00 I would not want to either, but if she wants to get through
203,d06-111-01 the day without becoming exhausted, she will be well advised to
203,d06-111-02 sit down quietly and make a list of everything she has got to
203,d06-111-03 do, note the order in which they can most conveniently be
203,d06-111-04 done (or must be done because of other predetermined factors
203,d06-111-05 - you must, for example, do your shopping on the morning of
203,d06-111-06 the early closing day).
208,d06-113-00 She will, in fact, be surprised at what peace
208,d06-113-01 of mind ensues. (b) Concentrate on one
208,d06-113-02 thing at a time. A list or a plan enables us to
208,d06-113-03 put all our energies into the particular
208,d06-113-04 matter on hand.
209,d07-082-00 (Actually, the Mishnah quotes two further proof
209,d07-082-01 texts and the Gemara explains why these,
209,d07-082-02 too, are necessary, but a careful examination
209,d07-082-03 of that passage makes it clear that these are
209,d07-082-04 not quoted here because they are not
209,d07-082-05 necessary to prove the point made by
209,d07-082-06 R. Joshua b. Levi.) Finally, we note that
209,d07-082-07 the comment of Rami bar Rabh is quoted
209,d07-082-08 elsewhere.
209,d07-085-00 From the above it follows that here, once again,
209,d07-085-01 we have a good illustration of how a
209,d07-085-02 sugya has been fashioned from material
209,d07-085-03 already in the hands of the Redactors.
209,d07-085-04 The sugya is built around the saying of
209,d07-085-05 R. Joshua b. Levi. The proof text for the
209,d07-085-06 reading of the Book of Esther is quoted
209,d07-085-07 with the comment given by Samuel.
209,d07-089-00 (This is probably to be understood as a well-
209,d07-089-01 known comment on the verse; quoted by
209,d07-089-02 Samuel in support of his thesis and quoted
209,d07-089-03 by the Gemara in support of R. Joshua b.
209,d07-089-04 Levi's thesis!) The proof text of greeting by
209,d07-089-05 the divine Name is taken from the Mishnah.
209,d07-089-06 There is no reference to the Mishnah here
209,d07-089-07 because the Mishnah deals with the
209,d07-089-08 actual practice of greeting by the divine
209,d07-089-09 Name and the Gemara here quotes the
209,d07-089-10 texts to support the thesis of R. Joshua b. Levi.
209,d07-093-00 The question and answer with regard to the
209,d07-093-01 need for the text of the angel are quoted
209,d07-093-02 here in the same words in which they are
209,d07-093-03 quoted in the discussion on the Mishnah.
209,d07-093-04 This can either mean that both sugyas are
209,d07-093-05 quoting a well-known question and
209,d07-093-06 answer or that our sugya is quoting from
209,d07-093-07 the longer sugya which deals with all
209,d07-093-08 four texts quoted in the Mishnah.
209,d07-096-00 Or it is possible that our sugya contains the
209,d07-096-01 original question and answer and this is quoted
209,d07-096-02 in the other sugya. (This can be supported by the
209,d07-096-03 use of the expression: 'Boaz did it of his own
209,d07-096-04 accord but there was no approval of his action
209,d07-096-05 in Heaven' in both sugyoth. Such an
209,d07-096-06 expression appears to have been framed in
209,d07-096-07 response to the particular point at issue here,
209,d07-096-08 whether the Heavenly Court concurred
209,d07-096-09 in the decision of the human court.)
209,d07-100-00 The proof text of bringing the tithe to the Temple
209,d07-100-01 is then quoted and the interpretation of the
209,d07-100-02 latter part of the verse by Rami bar Rabh
209,d07-100-03 is added, not because this is at all relevant
209,d07-100-04 to the discussion but because it was
209,d07-100-05 a familiar interpretation which had
209,d07-100-06 become so well known that it was
209,d07-100-07 invariably quoted whenever the verse
209,d07-100-08 itself was quoted, almost as if it were a
209,d07-100-09 part of the verse.
209,d07-102-00 The Gemara continues with a saying of the
209,d07-102-01 Palestinian teacher, R. Eleazar (3rd Cent.):
209,d07-102-02 'The Holy Spirit manifested itself in three places:
209,d07-102-03 the court of Shem, the court of Samuel of Ramah,
209,d07-102-04 and the court of Solomon.' The place of this
209,d07-102-05 saying here is obvious, it follows naturally
209,d07-102-06 on the saying of R. Joshua b. Levi which
209,d07-102-07 deals with a similar theme.
181,e01-055-00 One can remember with horror the pictures of the
181,e01-055-01 overcrowded and over-embellished drawing-rooms
181,e01-055-02 complete with heavy crochet antimacassars, mantel-
181,e01-055-03 piece covers with a fringing of clumsy bobbles and
181,e01-055-04 numerous other crocheted pieces. It was some years
181,e01-055-05 after the Victorian period that designers realised
181,e01-055-06 the potentialities of the craft, and crochet was
181,e01-055-07 revived with designs suitable for contemporary
181,e01-055-08 trends. Crochet today has a variety of uses, and
181,e01-055-09 has even stepped into the field of high fashion.
206,e06-000-00 This could hardly happen without the
206,e06-000-01 herring having some orientation with the
206,e06-000-02 sea bottom. It means that the crowding
206,e06-000-03 is caused during the daytime, and that
206,e06-000-04 the herring must continue to migrate over
206,e06-000-05 the ground as well as in midwater and
206,e06-000-06 during the swim (the swim at East Anglia
206,e06-000-07 is always from the north).
204,e06-003-00 Thus we can see that herring
204,e06-003-01 movements, although primarily
204,e06-003-02 instinctive perhaps, and certainly
204,e06-003-03 helped and hindered by water flow,
204,e06-003-04 are also closely related to the sea-bed
204,e06-003-05 geography. Geography, too, names the
204,e06-003-06 great fisheries that depend on them:
204,e06-003-07 the Fladen Ground (where again most big
204,e06-003-08 shots are taken on the edges), the Gut,
204,e06-003-09 a deep-water channel to the Dogger where
204,e06-003-10 the herring spawn along the northern
203,e06-010-00 In this 200-fathom trench the herring do not touch the bottom.
203,e06-010-01 Their descent stops at the end of the light pressure. But
203,e06-010-02 they migrate easterly to the Norwegian side, or westerly, until
203,e06-010-03 in the shallower water the mile wide layers disappear from the
203,e06-010-04 echo-sounders. Bottom crowding comes when they cannot reach
203,e06-010-05 their optimum depth; and this coincides with the suitable
203,e06-010-06 gravelly soil of these many roughs where the spring-
203,e06-010-07 spawning herring are always found.
204,e06-015-00 The joint evidence of echo-sounders
204,e06-015-01 and fishing gear leads to an overall
204,e06-015-02 though somewhat dim picture.
204,e06-015-03 The details are harder still to see.
204,e06-015-04 Drift Effects. At East Anglia, for instance,
204,e06-015-05 shoals that gather at the Knoll or
204,e06-015-06 other banks are most of them
204,e06-015-07 going to travel a hundred
204,e06-015-08 miles farther south before they
204,e06-015-09 spawn. Some will spawn at the
206,e06-021-00 So the arrival of any particular shoal
206,e06-021-01 fish at a certain spawning ground may
206,e06-021-02 be accidental. Yet there will always be some
206,e06-021-03 that find it if enough are travelling, just as
206,e06-021-04 the robin who gets back exactly may be
206,e06-021-05 only one among thousands who do not.
206,e06-021-06 But this southerly migration is not
206,e06-021-07 accidental. Being contranatant or against
206,e06-021-08 the drift, it probably has a survival value
206,e06-021-09 in ensuring that the fry after hatching
206,e06-021-10 are drifted back into the normal home
205,e06-026-00 Drift in another form probably
205,e06-026-01 explains how these migrating herring
205,e06-026-02 are biased to east or west by the
205,e06-026-03 different winds. Strong westerlies
205,e06-026-04 are well known to bring good
205,e06-026-05 longshore fishings. The surface
205,e06-026-06 water that is blown offshore must
205,e06-026-07 be replaced by an underflow bringing
205,e06-026-08 with it the herring to the Norfolk
205,e06-026-09 and Suffolk beaches.
204,e06-030-00 Easterly winds, on the other hand,
204,e06-030-01 mean no herring along the shore, as
204,e06-030-02 recent years have shown. A succession
204,e06-030-03 of winds is needed for this effect of
204,e06-030-04 course - one breeze will not do it,
204,e06-030-05 though a very hard westerly will
204,e06-030-06 often start off the "local" herring;
204,e06-030-07 but quite apart from this wind effect
204,e06-030-08 there is an easterly drift special
204,e06-030-09 to this rump of coastline, caused by
204,e06-030-10 the meeting of water from north and south.
207,e06-033-00 Herring fishermen call this "the outset". It
207,e06-033-01 is strongest at spring tides, when without
207,e06-033-02 wind you will "set" out - or drift to the east-
207,e06-033-03 ward, the length of half a fleet of nets -
207,e06-033-04 almost a mile on every tide at the Smith's
207,e06-033-05 Knoll. Without an explanation of how it
207,e06-033-06 works, it may well be that this outset, akin
207,e06-033-07 to the mouth of a great salmon river, has
207,e06-033-08 been the biggest factor through the ages
207,e06-033-09 in the constancy of this great herring fishery.
203,e06-046-00 (Just how the seine ropes do this is not yet proved; it may
203,e06-046-01 be by actual contact, or by sight reaction to the disturbed
203,e06-046-02 sand; or even in the case of flat fish, by vibrations
203,e06-046-03 through or along the bottom.) But given such a bow
203,e06-046-04 wave of disturbance, it is obvious that without something
203,e06-046-05 to overcome its effect, very few fish would be caught.
205,e06-049-00 Let us consider first what would
205,e06-049-01 appear to be the simplest case -
205,e06-049-02 that of flat fish on the bottom.
205,e06-049-03 The evidence suggest that the fish are
205,e06-049-04 aware of the moving footrope before
205,e06-049-05 it reaches them. They move away before
205,e06-049-06 it, swimming at the same speed
205,e06-049-07 for an unknown period of time, until
205,e06-049-08 they become (1) tired, or (2) more used
205,e06-049-09 to the disturbance.
208,e06-053-00 Then they stop swimming and are caught. In
208,e06-053-01 the seine-net film this usually seemed to
208,e06-053-02 happen just after the fish had risen above
208,e06-053-03 the footrope, and presumably out of its
208,e06-053-04 field of disturbance, or bow wave. This suggests
208,e06-053-05 that the wave might be transmitted by the
208,e06-053-06 sea-bed, though the footrope in this case
208,e06-053-07 was actually just off the bottom and was
208,e06-053-08 indeed passing over some fish.
207,e06-070-00 Actually the seine net has little or no cover.
207,e06-070-01 And in this film the rise of the fish was
207,e06-070-02 small, a matter of a foot or two. With round
207,e06-070-03 fish like haddock, which would hardly
207,e06-070-04 find safety on the bottom, this cover
207,e06-070-05 would seem to be even more essential;
207,e06-070-06 but more films are needed to prove this.
207,e06-070-07 Cover in the fast-moving trawl is considered
207,e06-070-08 essential to catch round fish whose
207,e06-070-09 reaction to disturbance would be upwards.
276,f04-032-00 They also had to cope with the usual flood of rumours, so-
276,f04-032-01 me well meant, some mischievous, including one that a
276,f04-032-02 man had been seen fleeing from Vauxhall station on
276,f04-032-03 the Thursday evening, with blood actually dripping from
276,f04-032-04 his hands. The inquest was opened on February 17, but,
276,f04-032-05 beyond the jury hearing a formal identification of
276,f04-032-06 the victim and inspecting at Waterloo the carriage
276,f04-032-07 in which she had died, there was nothing on
276,f04-032-08 which to proceed, and the inquest was
276,f04-032-09 adjourned.
276,f04-035-00 Day by day the police followed up likely and even unlikely
276,f04-035-01 trails. It was learned that Elizabeth Camp had been lending
276,f04-035-02 money to her relatives, and her brother-in-law was asked for
276,f04-035-03 a detailed account of his movements on the 11th. The dead
276,f04-035-04 woman had been engaged once before - to a barman
276,f04-035-05 named Brown.
277,f04-039-00 This man agreed that his engagement had
277,f04-039-01 been broken off after one particular
277,f04-039-02 tiff, but denied that he owed Miss Camp any
277,f04-039-03 money. All the while the police were casting about
277,f04-039-04 for a man who had been seen leaving the train
277,f04-039-05 at Wandsworth. A passenger described this individual
277,f04-039-06 as a man of about thirty, of medium height, with
277,f04-039-07 a dark moustache, and wearing a frockcoat
277,f04-039-08 and a top-hat.
277,f04-043-00 The porter at the station bore out this
277,f04-043-01 description, but the man was not traced.
277,f04-043-02 Perhaps the news of their search got around,
277,f04-043-03 for a man did obligingly present himself
277,f04-043-04 at Wandsworth police-station, claiming to have
277,f04-043-05 committed the murder - but he was mentally
277,f04-043-06 defective, and, despite his claim to infamy,
277,f04-043-07 had been nowhere near the 7.42 that evening.
279,f04-053-00 And so the inquest, which had dragged on, with
279,f04-053-01 adjournments, until April 7, finally had to be content to return
279,f04-053-02 a verdict of "wilful murder against some person or
279,f04-053-03 persons unknown." The most vital clue of the Wedgwood
279,f04-053-04 pestle had been of no assistance. The killer must
279,f04-053-05 have been very thankful that the science of
279,f04-053-06 dactyloscopy was only in its beginnings.
279,f04-057-00 The next female fatality occurred eight years later,
279,f04-057-01 yet so strange were the circumstances that it was
279,f04-057-02 a further seven years before even a ghost of a
279,f04-057-03 solution emerged. There has always been something
279,f04-057-04 sinister in the idea of tunnels. The building of
279,f04-057-05 them was one of the most dangerous jobs con-
279,f04-057-06 nected with railway construction; and there
279,f04-057-07 were many people who believed that to travel
279,f04-057-08 through tunnels would be an equally
279,f04-057-09 hazardous business.
280,f04-061-00 Some thought that the result would be all
280,f04-061-01 sorts of horrible illnesses brought on by the
280,f04-061-02 confined atmosphere. "The shareholders who travel
280,f04-061-03 by it will be so heartily sick, what with the
280,f04-061-04 foul air, smoke and sulphur, that the mention
280,f04-061-05 of a railway will be worse than Ipecacuanha,"
280,f04-061-06 wrote an anti-railway industrialist when it was
280,f04-061-07 proposed to build the Box Tunnel.
280,f04-064-00 The mere thought of subterranean travel
280,f04-064-01 gave others a feeling of danger. A medical journal
280,f04-064-02 said, "the deafening peal of thunder, the sudden
280,f04-064-03 immersion in gloom, and the clash of reverberated
280,f04-064-04 sounds in a confined space combine to produce a
280,f04-064-05 momentary shudder, or idea of destruction, a thrill
280,f04-064-06 of annihilation." It was also prophesied that
280,f04-064-07 passengers would be robbed and assaulted in the
280,f04-064-08 darkness.
281,f04-068-00 For all that, as far as England is concerned,
281,f04-068-01 there have been only two occasions on
281,f04-068-02 which a body has been found in a tunnel
281,f04-068-03 in circumstances pointing to murder.
281,f04-068-04 The first was that of Mr Gold, in the famous
281,f04-068-05 Lefroy case, and by an odd chance the second tragedy
281,f04-068-06 occurred on the same line, although this time the
281,f04-068-07 victim was a woman.
281,f04-071-00 Though in the minds of most people there was
281,f04-071-01 no doubt that the woman had been the victim
281,f04-071-02 of foul play, the verdict brought in was that there
281,f04-071-03 was not sufficient evidence to show whether
281,f04-071-04 she had fallen or been thrown from a train.
281,f04-071-05 The Merstham Tunnel, on the London-to-
281,f04-071-06 Brighton line, is approximately one mile long,
281,f04-071-07 and some time before midnight on September
281,f04-071-08 24, 1905, a Sunday, Sub-Inspector Peacock, of
281,f04-071-09 the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway,
282,f04-074-00 It was the battered and broken body of a woman.
282,f04-074-01 He sent word straight away to near-by Merstham
282,f04-074-02 Station, and a stretcher party took the body to
282,f04-074-03 the Feathers Hotel to await identification.
282,f04-074-04 Was it a case of suicide, where some unhappy soul
282,f04-074-05 had walked deliberately into the blackness and
282,f04-074-06 into the path of some train? This hardly seemed
282,f04-074-07 likely, since, when she was examined by a local
282,f04-074-08 doctor, the woman, young, small, and rather plump,
282,f04-074-09 was found to have her own silk scarf drawn
282,f04-074-10 almost tight enough to strangle her, and the ends
282,f04-074-11 thrust in her mouth like a gag.
282,f04-079-00 Both her wrists bore the marks of severe bruising,
282,f04-079-01 and there were other injuries on her body which had
282,f04-079-02 occurred before her death was ensured by some
282,f04-079-03 train which had roared through the tunnel. There were
282,f04-079-04 no letters or papers found on her to assist identi
282,f04-079-05 fication, no money, and no railway ticket. By then
282,f04-079-06 reports were being gathered about all traffic over
282,f04-079-07 this stretch of line, but no information was
282,f04-079-08 forthcoming about any carriage with an open
282,f04-079-09 door, nor any passenger reporting an incident
282,f04-079-10 which might relate.
283,f04-083-00 So the body of this small girl with the blue eyes and
283,f04-083-01 long brown hair in a bun at the back of her head
283,f04-083-02 remained a mystery until later the following day.
283,f04-083-03 During that time a description of the girl was
283,f04-083-04 circulated, and a Mr Robert Money came forward to
283,f04-083-05 identify her as his sister, Mary Money, aged twenty-two.
283,f04-083-06 The girl, who was described as being "always bright and
283,f04-083-07 jolly," had been unmarried, and lived at Lavender Hill,
283,f04-083-08 Clapham, on the premises of a dairyman, Bridger, for
283,f04-083-09 whom she worked as a book-keeper.
283,f04-087-00 On the Sunday, the day of her death, she had gone out in the
283,f04-087-01 evening at about seven o'clock, telling her room-mate, Emma
283,f04-087-02 Hone, that she was going for a walk, but would not be
283,f04-087-03 gone for long. According to Miss Hone, she had not been
283,f04-087-04 carrying a handbag, but she believed she had had a small
283,f04-087-05 purse.
285,f07-000-00 SOME years ago a contemporary philosopher
285,f07-000-01 told us that there was nothing an En-
285,f07-000-02 glishman would not do; nothing an Ame-
285,f07-000-03 rican would not say; nothing an
285,f07-000-04 Italian would not sing; no music
285,f07-000-05 to which the Frenchman would not
285,f07-000-06 dance; nothing the German would
285,f07-000-07 not covet; and nothing the Chinese
285,f07-000-08 would not eat.
286,f07-000b-00 SOME years ago a contemporary philosopher
286,f07-000b-01 told us that there was nothing an Englishman
286,f07-000b-02 would not do; nothing an American would not
286,f07-000b-03 say; nothing an Italian would not sing; no
286,f07-000b-04 music to which the Frenchman would not dance;
286,f07-000b-05 nothing the German would not covet; and
286,f07-000b-06 nothing the Chinese would not eat.
286,f07-002-00 It is not our purpose to discuss this dictum.
286,f07-002-01 Suffice to say that few of us stop to marvel at
286,f07-002-02 the progress of civilisation which allows a dish
286,f07-002-03 borrowed straight from the prehistoric. How
286,f07-002-04 many centuries ago, in some cave or hilly
286,f07-002-05 hide, did our forebears home from the chase
286,f07-002-06 hold forth from a spear the welcome gobbet of
286,f07-002-07 meat or fish burnt and roasted in the
286,f07-002-08 homely and protecting flame.
286,f07-006-00 How many centuries later did the mercenary in
286,f07-006-01 the Roman wars thus impale on pike or lance his
286,f07-006-02 evening meal. Later came the thrifty peasant,
286,f07-006-03 later still the young Victorian buck adventuring
286,f07-006-04 in Paris, and even later our attractive young
286,f07-006-05 ladies toying with these primitive morsels in the
286,f07-006-06 gleam and glitter of our latter-day restaurants.
286,f07-009-00 And, if certain dishes and modes of food have
286,f07-009-01 persisted down the ages, the motive that preserved
286,f07-009-02 them has always been the same. Apart from the need
286,f07-009-03 for nourishment, the instinct of hospitality has
286,f07-009-04 always been strong in mankind. The sharing of
286,f07-009-05 a meal in those earliest dangerous days was an
286,f07-009-06 admittance into an acquaintanceship far more
286,f07-009-07 important than the casual meetings of the present
286,f07-009-08 day; the desire to share something more intimate
286,f07-009-09 than mere converse has always been there.
287,f07-013-00 The truth is that good food offers a
287,f07-013-01 programme of entertainment almost
287,f07-013-02 unlimited in its variety and its presen-
287,f07-013-03 tation affords an opportunity of
287,f07-013-04 showing a guest something of ourselves.
287,f07-013-05 It is a far enough cry from the primitive
287,f07-013-06 meal-times of a simpler world to the
287,f07-013-07 banquets of later days, when the table
287,f07-013-08 groaned under its load of complicated
287,f07-013-09 dishes, and for all the blossoming of the
287,f07-013-10 arts around them the diners were little
287,f07-016-00 There was always the spice of an orgy
287,f07-016-01 in those Roman feasts, for instance, with
287,f07-016-02 all their peacocks and nightingales'
287,f07-016-03 tongues; unreasonable surfeit, too, in the
287,f07-016-04 elaborate fashion of eating brought
287,f07-016-05 out of Italy into France, we are told,
287,f07-016-06 by Catherine de Medici. The peasant in
287,f07-016-07 those days, as ever, ate sparingly, but
287,f07-016-08 generously enough in his own fashion,
287,f07-016-09 save at feast times, when he, too, let
287,f07-016-10 himself go; and it was from his simpler
288,f07-019a-00 Epicures and gourmands, sated by the unending
288,f07-019a-01 procession of dishes from those mammoth kitchens
288,f07-019a-02 of the 18th century - that amazing epoch of
288,f07-019a-03 grossness and delicacy - sought inspiration at last from
288,f07-019a-04 the dishes of the country, and, instead of gorging the
288,f07-019a-05 eye with magnitude, began to understand the value of
288,f07-019a-06 intelligent selection and comparative simplicity, though
288,f07-019a-07 nowadays their simplified meals would seem quite
288,f07-019a-08 monstrous.

288,f07-021a-00 Does one, however, know who first thought of boiling
288,f07-021a-01 water and food? The ancient Britons, I believe, used to
288,f07-021a-02 make water hot by dropping a red-hot poker into it,
288,f07-021a-03 because their pots would not stand fire; but Jacob
288,f07-021a-04 must have had one that would, because Esau sold
288,f07-021a-05 his birthright to him for a mess of pottage - and
288,f07-021a-06 then we hear of the fleshpots of Egypt after
288,f07-021a-07 which the Israelites sighed.

288,f07-024a-00 Anyhow, Homer does not seem to have known any
288,f07-024a-01 way of cooking meat except by roasting and boiling.
288,f07-024a-02 When Achilles gave a royal feast the principal dish
288,f07-024a-03 was a grill, which he cooked himself, and he knew
288,f07-024a-04 how to do it, too: - When the languid flames at
288,f07-024a-05 length subside, He throws a bed of glowing
288,f07-024a-06 embers wide; Above the coals the smoking
288,f07-024a-07 fragment turns, And sprinkles sacred salt from
288,f07-024a-08 lifted urns
287,f07-024b-00 Anyhow, Homer does not seem to have
287,f07-024b-01 known any way of cooking meat
287,f07-024b-02 except by roasting and boiling. When
287,f07-024b-03 Achilles gave a royal feast the principal
287,f07-024b-04 dish was a grill, which he cooked himself,
287,f07-024b-05 and he knew how to do it, too: - When the

288,f07-028a-00 When, however, the Greeks did learn the art of making
288,f07-028a-01 fireproof earthenware from the Egyptians, their cookery
288,f07-028a-02 made rapid progress, because they were men of taste
288,f07-028a-03 and intellect. A remarkable peculiarity in the banquets
288,f07-028a-04 of the ancient world was the fact that they did not
288,f07-028a-05 confine the resources of the table to the gratification
288,f07-028a-06 of one sense alone. Having exhausted their invention
288,f07-028a-07 in the preparation of stimulants for the palate,
288,f07-028a-08 they broke fresh ground and called another sense
288,f07-028a-09 to their aid.
288,f07-032a-00 By delicate application of odours and richly-distilled
288,f07-032a-01 perfumes, these refined voluptuaries aroused the
288,f07-032a-02 fainting appetite and added a more exquisite and
288,f07-032a-03 ethereal enjoyment to the grosser pleasures of the
288,f07-032a-04 board. The gratification of the sense of smelling
288,f07-032a-05 was a subject of no little importance to the Romans.
288,f07-032a-06 They considered flowers as forming a very essential
288,f07-032a-07 article in their festal preparations; and it is the
288,f07-032a-08 opinion of Bassius that at their desserts the
288,f07-032a-09 number of flowers far exceeded the number
288,f07-032a-10 of fruits.
285,f07-039a-00 According to Pliny, and others, certain herbs
285,f07-039a-01 and flowers proved of sovereign power
285,f07-039a-02 clarifying the functions of the brain. It
285,f07-039a-03 is said that there is nothing new under
285,f07-039a-04 the sun, but regarding foodstuffs the
285,f07-039a-05 traveller occasionally encounters a certain
285,f07-039a-06 measure of novelty.
285,f07-042a-00 In China, for instance, dried rats are esteemed
285,f07-042a-01 a delicacy. The visitor is told that
285,f07-042a-02 they restore the hair of the bald and that
285,f07-042a-03 a stewed black rat will ward off a fever.
285,f07-042a-04 A number of newly-born white mice served
285,f07-042a-05 alive, dipped in treacle and swallowed
285,f07-042a-06 like a prairie oyster is considered a
285,f07-042a-07 piece of resistance.
285,f07-046a-00 Among the natives of Northern Australia lizards
285,f07-046a-01 roasted on the point of a spear are
285,f07-046a-02 definitely a delicacy while Mediterranean
285,f07-046a-03 peoples have a high opinion of the octopus
285,f07-046a-04 as an article of diet. So have the Japanese
285,f07-046a-05 and the Chinese. The Celestials, apart
285,f07-046a-06 from eating it fresh, squash it, press
285,f07-046a-07 it and dry it, in which form, dusted
285,f07-046a-08 over with flour, you will find a stack
285,f07-046a-09 of it in almost any provision shop.
291,f07-069-00 Foodlore reflects much more of national temperament
291,f07-069-01 than is customarily imagined as well as entering human
291,f07-069-02 activities to a greater extent than is usually assumed.
291,f07-069-03 We naturally cannot overlook that Magyar cookery owes
291,f07-069-04 one of its most classic features to the Turkish rule under
291,f07-069-05 which the Hungarians groaned for nearly 200 years.
291,f07-069-06 If that country had not been for so long a battlefield red
291,f07-069-07 with the blood shed to defend Christian civilisation,
291,f07-069-08 Hungary would have been deprived of the condiment which
291,f07-069-09 provides many Magyar dishes with a vivid and brilliant
291,f07-073-00 The Austrian cuisine embraces the delectable 6Wiener
291,f07-073-01 Schnitzel as well as dishes and stews heightened with
291,f07-073-02 aromatics where the paprika insinuates its perfidious
291,f07-073-03 fire, aerian creams, ingenious pastries and a
291,f07-073-04 crescent-shaped breakfast roll created by a pastry cook to
291,f07-073-05 celebrate the victory against the Turks in 1683. Spanish
291,f07-073-06 cookery is reminiscent of bull-fights, of Spanish dancing
291,f07-073-07 and of Goja: it is vivid, highly coloured, sometimes
291,f07-073-08 Quixotic and withal it has a sombre ardour, with
291,f07-073-09 streaks of poetry, meat disguised under heavy and vehement
292,f07-076a-00 The Czechoslovak kitchen, again, is
292,f07-076a-01 so languorous, so passionate, and
292,f07-076a-02 possibly comparable alone to a gypsy
292,f07-076a-03 melody. The paprika and caraway perfume
292,f07-076a-04 the meats with their antithesis. The
292,f07-076a-05 opulent varieties of Czechoslovak past-
292,f07-076a-06 ries recall in fact the rich heritage
292,f07-076a-07 of rich embroideries and costumes
292,f07-076a-08 specifically national. The art and
292,f07-076a-09 science of cookery, however, is
292,f07-076a-10 essentially French, and, irrespective of
292,f07-081a-00 The French have an inborn appreciation
292,f07-081a-01 of good food and the gusto which they
292,f07-081a-02 derive from gastronomy is intellectual
292,f07-081a-03 and aesthetic as well as physical.
292,f07-081a-04 There is the same finesse about their
292,f07-081a-05 feeding, the same subtle delicacy of
292,f07-081a-06 touch, the same unfailing sense of
292,f07-081a-07 proportion as exists among her
292,f07-081a-08 writers, music composers and other
292,f07-081a-09 exponents of things that are
292,f07-081a-10 typically French.

292,f07-084a-00 The "pot-au-feu" is as much a national
292,f07-084a-01 institution in France as is tea drinking
292,f07-084a-02 among ourselves and it is prepared at
292,f07-084a-03 least once a week in every bourgeois
292,f07-084a-04 household. Thackeray, of course,
292,f07-084a-05 waxed enthusiastic about Bouilla-
292,f07-084a-06 baisse and sang - This Bouillabaisse
292,f07-084a-07 a noble dish is, A sort of soup, or
292,f07-084a-08 broth, or brew, A hotch-potch of all
292,f07-084a-09 sorts of fishes That Greenwich never
292,f07-084a-10 could outdo; Green herbs, red peppers,

292,f07-088a-00 A fascinating study also opens up in
292,f07-088a-01 the dietary welcomed by men of genius
292,f07-088a-02 as well as the foods for which they have
292,f07-088a-03 had an aversion. Shelley, for example,
292,f07-088a-04 had a great contempt for animal
292,f07-088a-05 food, believing that it impaired the
292,f07-088a-06 intellectual faculties. Bunyan's break-
292,f07-088a-07 fast and supper consisted of a
292,f07-088a-08 piece of coarse bread and a
292,f07-088a-09 bowl of milk.
293,f07-088b-00 A fascinating study also opens up in the dietary
293,f07-088b-01 welcomed by men of genius as well as the foods for
293,f07-088b-02 which they have had an aversion. Shelley, for example,
293,f07-088b-03 had a great contempt for animal food, believing that

292,f07-092a-00 Dante Gabriel Rossetti had simple tastes
292,f07-092a-01 in food. At one dinner he is said to have
292,f07-092a-02 been blind to the charms of turbot and
292,f07-092a-03 to have been much more interested
292,f07-092a-04 in the dish in which it was served. He
292,f07-092a-05 turned it over on the table cloth to
292,f07-092a-06 examine the marks on the back
292,f07-092a-07 without going through the formality
292,f07-092a-08 of having his turbot removed first.
293,f07-092b-00 Dante Gabriel Rossetti had simple tastes in food. At one
293,f07-092b-01 dinner he is said to have been blind to the charms of
293,f07-092b-02 turbot and to have been much more interested in the
293,f07-092b-03 dish in which it was served. He turned # it over
293,f07-092b-04 on the table cloth to examine the marks on the back

293,f07-092b-06 removed first.
293,f07-096-00 Wagner was a highly practical feeder. He ate very fast,
293,f07-096-01 placing his food in his mouth and gulping it down as
293,f07-096-02 he talked. Brigham Young would make a dinner on tripe
293,f07-096-03 which he washed down with beer. A writer who had dinner
293,f07-096-04 with Dickens says the menu was Whitstable oysters, a brown
293,f07-096-05 sole, a baked leg of mutton with oyster & veal stuffing and a
293,f07-096-06 gin punch.
293,f07-101b-00 The same man went to see Carlyle, and, after mentioning
293,f07-101b-01 that he had dined with Longfellow told the sage a
293,f07-101b-02 very funny story which made Carlyle absolutely laugh;
293,f07-101b-03 but all the Chelsea philosopher did in return was to
293,f07-101b-04 ask if his guest would have a cup of tea!
295,g01-004-00 It was naturally a highly popular victory with the
295,g01-004-01 Londoners, but it brought heavy censure from nobles
295,g01-004-02 who still believed that they had a monopoly of
295,g01-004-03 leadership. But, at last, Gaunt sailed. Opposing
295,g01-004-04 him was the French Admiral, Jean de Vienne -
295,g01-004-05 a great sailor and an able strategist.
295,g01-008-00 Obedient to the policy of his King, de Vienne avoided
295,g01-008-01 trouble at sea as cleverly as Du Guesclin avoided it
295,g01-008-02 on land. Gaunt was compelled to give up his search for
295,g01-008-03 an elusive foe, and, afraid to return home without
295,g01-008-04 something to show, he foolishly attempted to besiege
295,g01-008-05 the well-protected fortress of St Malo. This
295,g01-008-06 involved the dreary method of mining operations in
295,g01-008-07 which Gaunt, under the Black Prince, had shown
295,g01-008-08 considerable skill at the siege of Limoges.
296,g01-012-00 When all seemed to be going well, a sortie surprised
296,g01-012-01 moment had charge of the mine; the mine collapsed
296,g01-012-02 fame and glory. Gaunt was compelled to return
296,g01-012-03 even despised failure. The 'ribald' Londoners, who
296,g01-012-04 Hawley, were also expressing their disappointment
296,g01-012-05 comparing the failure of a subsidized duke
296,g01-012-06 citizen.
296,g01-016-00 These dreary years of ineffective fighting provide
296,g01-016-01 obvious morals for those who are judges long
296,g01-016-02 after the event. It seems obvious that, though
296,g01-016-03 the longbows of yeomen could pierce the
296,g01-016-04 plate and mail of French knights, a brilliant
296,g01-016-05 battle was no substitute for a sound policy,
296,g01-016-06 and that, if archers had no target, campaigns
296,g01-016-07 became mere marauding route marches.
296,g01-019-00 It seems obvious that if an expedition to
296,g01-019-01 Brittany was compelled to attack via Calais,
296,g01-019-02 then the primary essential to the success
296,g01-019-03 of the French war was a navy in unquestioned
296,g01-019-04 command of the Channel. It seems obvious
296,g01-019-05 that divided forces were dissipating the
296,g01-019-06 advantages of a ring of bridge-heads which included
296,g01-019-07 Calais, Cherbourg, Brest, Bordeaux and Bayonne,
296,g01-019-08 and that there was no hope of final victory
296,g01-019-09 without a large-scale and concentrated invasion.
297,g01-022-00 BUT NONE OF THESE DEDUCTIONS WERE
297,g01-022-01 DRAWN AT THE TIME, BECAUSE LARGE-
297,g01-022-02 SCALE WAR REQUIRED MONEY, AND
297,g01-022-03 THE CITIZENS WHO HAD THE MONEY
297,g01-022-04 WERE NOT YET SUFFICIENTLY AT
297,g01-022-05 ONE WITH NOBLES AND KING TO THINK
297,g01-022-06 THEIR MONEY WELL SPENT IN FIN-
297,g01-022-07 ANCING A RULING CLASS WHICH
297,g01-022-08 DESPISED THEM. THE COMMONS WERE
297,g01-022-09 GLAD ENOUGH TO ENJOY THE FRUITS
297,g01-025-00 In this cruel process which was
297,g01-025-01 hammering out nations on the anvils of
297,g01-025-02 war, there was a constant stirring of
297,g01-025-03 those in authority to find some simple
297,g01-025-04 way out of the complicated financial
297,g01-025-05 6impasse which always resulted, and in the
297,g01-025-06 story of the experiments and expedients
297,g01-025-07 to which the Exchequer resorted is
297,g01-025-08 the story of the prelude to the
297,g01-025-09 Peasants' Revolt of 1381.
297,g01-027-00 In appreciating this story, modern con-
297,g01-027-01 ceptions of governmental duties must be
297,g01-027-02 set aside. A modern government needs
297,g01-027-03 taxation not merely for defence and
297,g01-027-04 offence but for a very wide range of
297,g01-027-05 social services. A mediaeval oligarchy
297,g01-027-06 needed taxation in order to supplement
297,g01-027-07 the private wealth of the monarchy
297,g01-027-08 (the royal income from the revenues of
297,g01-027-09 crown lands, the fees of feudalism
298,g01-031-00 Social service as a function of government
298,g01-031-01 was quite alien to mediaeval thought - its
298,g01-031-02 substitute was the mutual self-help of
298,g01-031-03 communities, whether those communities were
298,g01-031-04 monasteries, manors, townships, or wards and
298,g01-031-05 guilds of a city. A mediaeval tax was
298,g01-031-06 therefore in essence a forced payment whose
298,g01-031-07 return was the uncertain bounty of booty
298,g01-031-08 and the vague advantages of military glory;
298,g01-031-09 it was therefore always granted grudgingly
298,g01-031-10 and coupled with the vain hope that, in the
298,g01-034-00 When 'his' war did not bring victory and
298,g01-034-01 booty, a new group of Lords might oust
298,g01-034-02 the unsuccessful leaders, and the Commons,
298,g01-034-03 who usually supplied the hard cash, might
298,g01-034-04 be bold enough to demand the production of
298,g01-034-05 accounts, and even at times the impeachment of
298,g01-034-06 the unsuccessful. But the Commons were not
298,g01-034-07 the people, and even a full Parliament was
298,g01-034-08 not yet a true mirror of the nation.
298,g01-037-00 The people - Langland's 'folk' and Gaunt's
298,g01-037-01 'knaves' - were villeins still tied to the
298,g01-037-02 feudal obligations of work or villeins who
298,g01-037-03 had bought their release, free labourers
298,g01-037-04 who worked for the highest bidders, free
298,g01-037-05 yeomen who had prospered enough to become
298,g01-037-06 successful farmers, the artisans, craftsmen,
298,g01-037-07 journeymen and small tradesmen of the
298,g01-037-08 towns, and the retainers and men-at-arms
298,g01-037-09 in the pay of landed Lords.
299,g01-039-00 None of these classes, except the yeomen, paid or
299,g01-039-01 expected to pay direct taxes. During the four-
299,g01-039-02 teenth century, the traditional methods of
299,g01-039-03 financing the Exchequer had become stabilized.
299,g01-039-04 When the King and his Council required additio-
299,g01-039-05 nal funds, they were usually granted an
299,g01-039-06 export tax on the wool trade, collected by
299,g01-039-07 means of that 'staple' system which ensured that
299,g01-039-08 prices, quality and tax could be efficiently su-
299,g01-039-09 pervised and controlled, together with a
299,g01-043-00 There were two other sources of public revenue -
299,g01-043-01 first, the Church, which wisely followed the lead
299,g01-043-02 of the Commons and in its own Convocations
299,g01-043-03 granted equivalent contributions, and second,
299,g01-043-04 the foreign merchants, with whom the King's
299,g01-043-05 officials had formerly made private bargains
299,g01-043-06 at 'colloquies of merchants', and whose
299,g01-043-07 payments were now authorized by parliamentary
299,g01-043-08 sanction at a rate roughly fifty per cent in
299,g01-043-09 excess of the rate for native merchants.
299,g01-045-00 In addition to these revenues, the King had the
299,g01-045-01 financial benefits of his position at the head
299,g01-045-02 of the feudal system, as its chief landowner
299,g01-045-03 and the recipient of the fines of royal justice.
299,g01-045-04 It was, therefore, a complicated and not very
299,g01-045-05 satisfactory financial system in which the
299,g01-045-06 borders between private and public purse were
299,g01-045-07 as ill-defined as the borders between private
299,g01-045-08 and national war, and in which the comparati-
299,g01-045-09 vely simple obligations of the feudal pyramid
300,g01-067-00 But this time there was a very interesting
300,g01-067-01 attempt to apply a sliding scale to the
300,g01-067-02 payments demanded. The definition of an
300,g01-067-03 adult was altered to read 'over sixteen',
300,g01-067-04 and, where the poorest were to pay a groat,
300,g01-067-05 the Duke of Lancaster and the Archbishops
300,g01-067-06 of Canterbury and York were to pay ten marks,
300,g01-067-07 and between these two extremes a graduated
300,g01-067-08 scale of payments was fixed for the
300,g01-067-09 different classes of laymen and clerics.
300,g01-070-00 Again the resentment was widespread and
300,g01-070-01 the results disappointing - a tax estimated
300,g01-070-02 to yield 50,000 in fact raised only 27,000.
300,g01-070-03 In the following year, 1380, the last and
300,g01-070-04 most notorious third poll-tax was agreed
300,g01-070-05 by a Parliament which met at Northampton.
300,g01-070-06 There were dark reasons for a meeting so
300,g01-070-07 far away from the capital in a town with
300,g01-070-08 poor communications and not over supplied
300,g01-070-09 with hostelries and lodgings.
300,g01-074-00 London was again in turmoil; but this time
300,g01-074-01 over a question of trade rivalry. A rich mer-
300,g01-074-02 chant from Genoa had been murdered, and
300,g01-074-03 John de Kyrkby, a Londoner, was one of
300,g01-074-04 those charged with the crime. It is clear
300,g01-074-05 from the chronicles that this was a sordid
300,g01-074-06 quarrel between monopolists and interlopers.
300,g01-074-07 The city merchants were jealous of foreign
300,g01-074-08 merchants who could tempt court and
300,g01-074-09 baronage with rarer luxuries than those
302,g01-088-00 Trebling the rate was arrived at by a simple
302,g01-088-01 arithmetic which argued that, as the first
302,g01-088-02 poll-tax had supplied 22,000, a tax of
302,g01-088-03 three times the rate would produce 66,000.
302,g01-088-04 The only concession made in view of the
302,g01-088-05 objections to the first two poll-taxes was
302,g01-088-06 the suggestion that the rich should help
302,g01-088-07 the poor - but this was only a pious hope
302,g01-088-08 because no machinery was provided for
302,g01-088-09 carrying it into effect, and a subordinate
303,g02-059-00 In Chapter Two he gauged the nature of the heart's movements
303,g02-059-01 from the dissection of living animals, showing how these move-
303,g02-059-02 ments alternate with rests and are seen best in cold animals
303,g02-059-03 or in flagging warmer ones. At the time of its movement
303,g02-059-04 the heart becomes generally constricted, its walls thicken,
303,g02-059-05 its ventricles decrease in volume and it expels its
303,g02-059-06 content of blood, appearing paler in so doing in animals
303,g02-059-07 such as serpents, frogs, and the like.
304,g02-062-00 At one and the same time, therefore, occur the beat
304,g02-062-01 of the apex, the thickening of the heart walls, and
304,g02-062-02 the forcible expulsion of their contained blood by the
304,g02-062-03 contraction of the ventricles. Going on in Chapter Three
304,g02-062-04 to the movement of the arteries, likewise gauged from
304,g02-062-05 the dissections of living animals, Harvey noted that
304,g02-062-06 contraction of the heart and the apex beat occur in
304,g02-062-07 systole, simultaneously with dilatation of the arteries
304,g02-062-08 and of the artery-like vein, and expulsion of the
304,g02-062-09 ventricular content.
305,g02-065-00 Arterial pulsation disappears with cessation of
305,g02-065-01 ventricular contraction. During cutting or puncture of
305,g02-065-02 the ventricles, there is often forcible expulsion
305,g02-065-03 of blood from the wound. Arterial diastole is
305,g02-065-04 thus synchronous with cardiac systole but,
305,g02-065-05 when movement of blood through arteries is
305,g02-065-06 hindered by compression, infarction or inter-
305,g02-065-07 ception, the more distal arteries pulsate
305,g02-065-08 less because their pulse is nothing other
305,g02-065-09 than the impulse of the blood entering them.
307,g02-073-00 'And while the heart is slowly dying,
307,g02-073-01 one can sometimes see it - so to speak
307,g02-073-02 - rouse itself and, in reply to two or
307,g02-073-03 three auricular beats, produce a single
307,g02-073-04 ventricular one slowly and
307,g02-073-05 reluctantly and with an effort.'

308,g03-000-01 Yet in spite of the fact that his ideas did his
308,g03-000-02 business no good George would never conceal them.
308,g03-000-03 He was a socialist and believed in the right
308,g03-000-04 of the working class to control their own destiny, and
308,g03-000-05 said so. Being a craftsman and a skilled man,
308,g03-000-06 George won many prizes, and though some people
308,g03-000-07 would have nothing to do with him, others
308,g03-000-08 would, and the comrades helped in many
308,g03-000-09 ways.
309,g03-004-00 When eventually the ovens were fixed at the new shop, the tremen-
309,g03-004-01 dously hard work was if anything intensified. George used to
309,g03-004-02 mix 100 stone of bread in 12 hours, and Kate served in the
309,g03-004-03 shop, which was open from 8 o'clock in the morning to
309,g03-004-04 12 o'clock at night. At that time pastries and buns
309,g03-004-05 were sold at 32 pieces for one shilling.
312,g03-032-00 Soon they were good enough to sing at meetings.
312,g03-032-01 One of the helpful by-products was that
312,g03-032-02 they were able to obtain some respectable
312,g03-032-03 clothing, with which they wore a white tie
312,g03-032-04 and Red Flag badge, thus presenting a much
312,g03-032-05 better appearance. Later, on many a sunny Sunday
312,g03-032-06 evening, when George went to speak at Malin Bridge,
312,g03-032-07 they would be there to begin the meeting.
313,g03-040-00 As they became known the Choir went to working-
313,g03-040-01 men's clubs, to Conisborough on cheap trips to
313,g03-040-02 sing to the miners, and sang for other organisations such
313,g03-040-03 as the Bakers' Union, for whom they went on Satur-
313,g03-040-04 day evenings to the Corner Pin Hotel, to rally
313,g03-040-05 the members. The B.S.P. also rented pleasant rooms
313,g03-040-06 on West Street, where a successful Sunday
313,g03-040-07 school was held.
314,g03-043-00 One of the students was young
314,g03-043-01 George, and another the dark-haired
314,g03-043-02 little granddaughter of Charlie Grant.
314,g03-043-03 George often spoke at the Sunday school.
314,g03-043-04 He christened the babies. Also, when
314,g03-043-05 called upon to do so, he would officiate
314,g03-043-06 at funerals. Religion was one of his pet
314,g03-043-07 subjects, for being well acquainted
314,g03-043-08 with the Bible, which he had
314,g03-043-09 read in prison where it was the
314,g03-043-10 only book they were allowed,
315,g03-049-00 Although his ideas were diametrically opposed
315,g03-049-01 to those of parsons he got on wonderfully well
315,g03-049-02 with them, particularly those who, like the Rev.
315,g03-049-03 Conrad Noel, the eloquent leader of
315,g03-049-04 the Church Socialist League, genuinely advocated
315,g03-049-05 socialism. With such men, who had the
315,g03-049-06 courage of their convictions and their
315,g03-049-07 Christianity, common ground could be found.
316,g03-052-00 There was no abatement in political
316,g03-052-01 work. The British Socialist Party endea-
316,g03-052-02 voured to get more socialist members sent to the
316,g03-052-03 Council, and to Parliament, being deter-
316,g03-052-04 mined and obdurate in their attitude that
316,g03-052-05 their candidate must go forward in the
316,g03-052-06 elections. In the Sheffield Trades and Labour
316,g03-052-07 Council meeting on October 16, 1912, George
316,g03-052-08 had said, 'Mr. Barton would go to the poll.
316,g03-052-09 Just as the Labour Party had fought the
316,g03-052-10 Liberals, they were going to fight the Labour
318,g03-064-00 Alf Barton, who in 1911 was presented
318,g03-064-01 with a book on the life of Marx,
318,g03-064-02 and a gold purse in recognition of his
318,g03-064-03 work for the movement, was later
318,g03-064-04 known to say that it was not ne-
318,g03-064-05 cessary to understand Marxism in order to
318,g03-064-06 understand socialism, though at this time
318,g03-064-07 he was a keen member of the B.S.P..
319,g04-022-00 After the First World War, 1914, I did not visit
319,g04-022-01 Germany for ten years, by which time in
319,g04-022-02 1924 I was in a different parish in Surrey.
319,g04-022-03 Towards the end of my five and a half years'
319,g04-022-04 incumbency I was asked if I would start
319,g04-022-05 a village choral society and conduct it.
319,g04-022-06 This opened up a new interest, and we plunged
319,g04-022-07 into it.
321,g04-043-00 But what a change from the dear little old church
321,g04-043-01 at Tatsfield to the great modern church of St. Mark's
321,g04-043-02 at Purley. One felt at Tatsfield that, small as the
321,g04-043-03 church was, it had its own atmosphere, and for centuries
321,g04-043-04 had been a House of Prayer. I could not but feel the
321,g04-043-05 chilliness of the new church, beautiful as it was and is.
321,g04-043-06 When we had found a group of people who gladly
321,g04-043-07 co-operated, we made the little side chapel a place
321,g04-043-08 of daily prayer.
321,g04-048-00 I suggested to the congregation that it needed
321,g04-048-01 warming up by constant prayer and worship, and we
321,g04-048-02 found many to help. Gifts of candlesticks and
321,g04-048-03 stained-glass lancet windows - finally a new altar -
321,g04-048-04 helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary
321,g04-048-05 for prayer and quiet. In time we received similar
321,g04-048-06 gifts for the High Altar, and large East and West
321,g04-048-07 windows.
322,g04-052-00 It was very interesting to have the privilege of filling
322,g04-052-01 such a beautiful building with suitable fittings; I made
322,g04-052-02 a rule that all gifts should be submitted for approval to
322,g04-052-03 the architect, himself a fine artist. It is quite possible
322,g04-052-04 to put beautiful things into a beautiful church
322,g04-052-05 and yet spoil the building with ornaments unsui-
322,g04-052-06 table to the environs.
325,g04-068-00 Meanwhile in Purley there was much activity and much
325,g04-068-01 co-operation especially with the other Christian communities.
325,g04-068-02 At a large public meeting we launched the project known as the
325,g04-068-03 'Coulsdon and Purley Patriotic Fund' in whose counsels and committees
325,g04-068-04 I found myself deeply involved. At first, the main work was to help
325,g04-068-05 wives and relations of the soldiers to get their 'Separation'
325,g04-068-06 allowances, but soon, alas!, as casualties began and increased
325,g04-068-07 in the winter of 1914 and 1915 the matter of War Pensions
325,g04-068-08 became very urgent, and I was asked to be Chairman
325,g04-068-09 of the Committee in Coulsdon and Purley.
325,g04-072-00 Indeed, for the next seventeen years, during my time at
325,g04-072-01 Purley, and from 1922 at Surbiton, I was continuously
325,g04-072-02 Chairman of the local War Pensions Committee. This
325,g04-072-03 task involved a very great deal of detailed work for
325,g04-072-04 the Committee. We had a splendid body of local residents,
325,g04-072-05 and a series of excellent Honorary Secretaries. Our
325,g04-072-06 Committee met once a week in the evenings, and
325,g04-072-07 included professional men from every walk of
325,g04-072-08 life.
293,g07-000b-00 When he saw Trelawny's printed letter, Lord Sidney wrote
293,g07-000b-01 to Douglas Kinnaird saying that it was incorrect
293,g07-000b-02 throughout. He had no sooner heard from Count Gamba
293,g07-000b-03 and Fletcher that Byron would have wished his
293,g07-000b-04 body to return to England than that course was
293,g07-000b-05 'immediately carried into effect' - not in spite of himself
293,g07-000b-06 and Sir Frederick Stoven, but with their perfect con-
293,g07-000b-07 currence, while 'General Adam was at Corfu the whole
293,g07-000b-08 time and # never interfered in the slightest
293,g07-000b-09 degree about the matter'.
285,g07-079a-00 Their friendship for Augusta became rather
285,g07-079a-01 hollow, and the news that Byron had left
285,g07-079a-02 her practically all his money caused it to
285,g07-079a-03 crumble to oblivion. Though Lady Byron
285,g07-079a-04 knew perfectly well that Byron, as early
285,g07-079a-05 as the year of their wedding, 1815, had
285,g07-079a-06 made a will in Augusta's favour, she had
285,g07-079a-07 evidently not passed on that information;
285,g07-079a-08 and it came as an appalling surprise to
285,g07-079a-09 Captain Byron that he had been left
285,g07-079a-10 without the fortune that would keep up the
285,g07-079a-11 title.
506,m01-049-00 He rose from his breakfast-nook bench
506,m01-049-01 and came into the livingroom, where
506,m01-049-02 Heather and Steve stood aghast at
506,m01-049-03 his entrance. He came, almost falling
506,m01-049-04 forward in an ungainly shuffle, neck
506,m01-049-05 thrust out, arms dangling loosely.
506,m01-049-06 Then, abruptly, he drew himself up
506,m01-049-07 and walked on the very tips of
506,m01-049-08 his toes. He stretched his arms
506,m01-049-09 over his head and yawned agape,
506,m01-049-10 drawing-in great breaths that
506,m01-049-11 became great sighs of ecstacy.
508,m01-060-00 "They have come!" he said reverently, gripping his
508,m01-060-01 hands together between his knees and leaning
508,m01-060-02 forward. "Isn't it a glorious thing! Long awaited
508,m01-060-03 transcendent event, the exalted desire of all
508,m01-060-04 mankind through all ages! The Kingdom of the
508,m01-060-05 Mind is at hand!" He turned beaming eyes
508,m01-060-06 upward and shook his head slowly from
508,m01-060-07 side to side.
509,m01-079-00 A superfluous precaution for there was no other car
509,m01-079-01 abroad; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait
509,m01-079-02 at an intersection for the light to change. At his
509,m01-079-03 apartment he garaged his car and then stood
509,m01-079-04 listening in the night. Listening in vain. For the
509,m01-079-05 earth had lost its life-tempo, as the heart
509,m01-079-06 loses its beat in death.
510,m01-084-00 Deadly stillness, deadly portent!
510,m01-084-01 Steve awakened early and switched on
510,m01-084-02 the radio, which he kept tuned to CBO.
510,m01-084-03 The set lighted-up but gave only a low
510,m01-084-04 buzzing sound. He had just finished
510,m01-084-05 shaving when it came on, with a flat
510,m01-084-06 voice repeating: "This is BBC calling
510,m01-084-07 . . . this is BBC calling. . ."
512,m01-095-00 Coming around the great mass of the Chateau
512,m01-095-01 Laurier, he braked to a screeching stop. A
512,m01-095-02 flying saucer was tilting and dipping over
512,m01-095-03 the War Memorial. There was a deep
512,m01-095-04 whirring sound, and a high-pitched hissing
512,m01-095-05 overtone that sang in his ears with an
512,m01-095-06 almost painful sharpness. He reversed and
512,m01-095-07 turned back on McKenzie Avenue.
513,m01-104-00 "The Thetans," he said, "are presumably here to
513,m01-104-01 take charge, as it were, of the minds of the
513,m01-104-02 people - who are probably falling all over them-
513,m01-104-03 selves in their zeal to get their orders and to carry
513,m01-104-04 them out. Just what these orders will be, we don't
513,m01-104-05 know. Now, because of prior hypnosis we have es-
513,m01-104-06 caped Thetan subjugation. This time. But we no
513,m01-104-07 longer have any immunity.
514,m01-110-00 There can be little doubt that if the
514,m01-110-01 Thetans discover our mental independence
514,m01-110-02 they will promptly give us their hypnotic
514,m01-110-03 treatment. If we can avoid undue
514,m01-110-04 prominence, it may be that we can
514,m01-110-05 move about pretty freely without
514,m01-110-06 detection. If we can - well, then we
514,m01-110-07 may be able to promote our own
514,m01-110-08 interests. What those interests
514,m01-110-09 are, beyond personal security,
514,m01-110-10 I haven't a clue; but, who knows,
514,m01-110-11 we may form the nucleus around ...
513,m01-121-00 There is just a hope that we may uncover
513,m01-121-01 some weakness, and find a way of fighting
513,m01-121-02 back at them." Heather agreed, and suggested
513,m01-121-03 that they use Dan as a specimen demonstra-
513,m01-121-04 ting how the Thetan machinations had been
513,m01-121-05 working out. It occurred to Steve that this may
513,m01-121-06 not have been entirely an objective suggestion
513,m01-121-07 on her part; but he thought it a good idea
513,m01-121-08 nevertheless.
516,m01-125-00 So they proceeded to see if the coast
516,m01-125-01 was clear. The street was quiet and
516,m01-125-02 deserted, and there were neither sight
516,m01-125-03 nor sound of flying saucers. So they
516,m01-125-04 ventured forth and made their way on
516,m01-125-05 foot to Dan's house. Dan came
516,m01-125-06 to the door at their ring but neglected
516,m01-125-07 to offer any greeting. He was deeply
516,m01-125-08 preoccupied, and it seemed that the
516,m01-125-09 ringing of a doorbell was to him
516,m01-125-10 a new and strange phenomenon.
514,m01-131-00 When he finally beckoned to them to enter, the action
514,m01-131-01 gave the impression of having been thought out and
514,m01-131-02 decided upon. Inside they sat down unbidden, while
514,m01-131-03 Dan paced the floor. He seemed completely unaware
514,m01-131-04 of their presence. They just stared at him, turning
514,m01-131-05 their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and
514,m01-131-06 down, up and down.
517,m01-136-00 His whole attitude was a mixture of
517,m01-136-01 impatience pending an awaited
517,m01-136-02 communication and of a vague
517,m01-136-03 perplexity respecting his surroundings
517,m01-136-04 and the purpose he was to serve.
517,m01-136-05 Finally, being so obviously on their own,
517,m01-136-06 Heather and Steve tried to make themselves
517,m01-136-07 at home. Steve switched on Dan's
517,m01-136-08 powerful, world-wide radio and systematically
517,m01-136-09 turned the tuning knob through all the
517,m01-136-10 tuning points of the world's great radio
518,m01-149-00 They followed him to a city bus stop on Carling Avenue, where
518,m01-149-01 he waited. The bus stop was a deserted island on an empty street.
518,m01-149-02 But not for long, for soon pedestrians and cars flocked upon
518,m01-149-03 the Avenue from its many tributary streets. It might have
518,m01-149-04 been a normal business-day bustle, except for two anomalies.
518,m01-149-05 First, it was Sunday morning; and, second, everyone
518,m01-149-06 walked, or drove, or waited as a person possessed of
518,m01-149-07 a single all-exclusive purpose.
520,m02-048-00 Then he would go back to Plato for a final spell of
520,m02-048-01 real days and would return to New York in late
520,m02-048-02 January or early February. Angelina might be a
520,m02-048-03 little sorry if we were not back for Christmas
520,m02-048-04 as arranged, but he consoled himself by
520,m02-048-05 thinking that he and Angelina would have
520,m02-048-06 plenty of time together in the future. And
520,m02-048-07 Heaven alone knew when, if ever, he would be
520,m02-048-08 back on Moon again, and able to do
520,m02-048-09 research at first hand into matters on which
520,m02-048-10 the future of everyone, including Angelina, depended...
522,m02-055-00 They had been married for six years, but the
522,m02-055-01 salary raise, on the expectation of which they
522,m02-055-02 had done so, had not materialised. "Do you
522,m02-055-03 know, I had to send back our bedroom
522,m02-055-04 furniture in the second year," she moaned. She
522,m02-055-05 had contacts in political circles, a school-
522,m02-055-06 friend of hers having married Lester Peron,
522,m02-055-07 a Mocrat Senator with a seat on the
522,m02-055-08 (literally) all-powerful Rocket Release
522,m02-055-09 Board.
522,m02-055-10 Hostettler
523,m02-059-00 Sometimes she took Harry around with her, but
523,m02-059-01 never her husband, a fact he accepted as inevitable. "I guess
523,m02-059-02 Sally made a mistake about me," he said one
523,m02-059-03 evening, when he had been left to cook his own meal.
523,m02-059-04 All Sally's relations were 4makrodeb now, but Tom
523,m02-059-05 was a Static Mib, the middle-income-bracket equivalent
523,m02-059-06 to 4sub-lil on the lower.
524,m02-066-00 All Aristotle was excited at the time, not by the prospect of the
524,m02-066-01 U.S. President's visit, but by a great storm in the photo-
524,m02-066-02 sphere of the sun. A matter which on Earth would hardly
524,m02-066-03 penetrate beyond the minds of astronomers was of general
524,m02-066-04 interest to the Mos, doubtless because their habitat is
524,m02-066-05 not submerged beneath a deep natural atmosphere.
525,m02-069-00 One wondered if this greater awareness of the physical cosmos might
525,m02-069-01 with time instil the reverence which, on Earth, nature inspires,
525,m02-069-02 especially when one reflected that the rockets over which Mr. Peron's
525,m02-069-03 Board presided had it in their power permanently to warp the
525,m02-069-04 solar system. True enough, such ultimate weapons had not been
525,m02-069-05 used in the last few wars, but it seemed very probable
525,m02-069-06 that they would be in the next one, Moon and her
525,m02-069-07 allies being more inferior than formerly to W.C.U. in the
525,m02-069-08 weapons pronounced conventional.
526,m02-072-00 Lester was not home yet from his formidable
526,m02-072-01 duties and his wife, in the manner of middle-brow
526,m02-072-02 wives, romanced about him in his absence. "Lester was a
526,m02-072-03 country lawyer, and we were very small 4microdebs, weren't we,
526,m02-072-04 Sally" - here she had dropped her voice in homage to the
526,m02-072-05 economic system: that was reverenced - "when he thought
526,m02-072-06 we might get GO a bit better if he entered politics.
528,m02-080-00 Sentence Database
528,m02-080-01 That's how he got the votes, that's how
528,m02-080-02 we came through to 4makrodeb status and
528,m02-080-03 got all these lovely things" - she waved a
528,m02-080-04 plump hand towards her grand pianos, etc:
528,m02-080-05 at the same time a door banged - "but don't
528,m02-080-06 say a word about it, Lester wants his
528,m02-080-07 mouth-organ to be forgotten now. The time
528,m02-080-08 has come for him to be taken seriously
528,m02-080-09 as a statesman."
530,m02-087-00 But privately he turned out to be as friendly as
530,m02-087-01 Mr. Wise the tube manufacturer, to have the same adolescent
530,m02-087-02 openness and freshness, though perhaps not the same
530,m02-087-03 maturity. One remembered that he was a lawyer
530,m02-087-04 by training, and suspected that the points he made
530,m02-087-05 so sharply in international politics were as abstract
530,m02-087-06 to him as those a lawyer makes in a court
530,m02-087-07 of law.
532,m02-095-00 The political life of Aristotle looked more and more
532,m02-095-01 like a masquerade of business interests in dis-
532,m02-095-02 guise which, far from attracting the allegiance
532,m02-095-03 of free men everywhere, could only repel them.
532,m02-095-04 Then what of the cultural life? Did this per-
532,m02-095-05 haps nurture a genuinely civilizing impulse
532,m02-095-06 which might in time become social fact
532,m02-095-07 and counteract the obsession with economics
532,m02-095-08 which had grown up during the Moon's
532,m02-095-09 first two centuries?
534,m02-109-00 Stepping out in their white shorts, they looked glad enough
534,m02-109-01 to be diverted, however, with the single exception of one
534,m02-109-02 worried little man-student who kept getting out of
534,m02-109-03 step. He looked as if nothing Moke and his
534,m02-109-04 minions could do to him would ever make him
534,m02-109-05 GO; but the reason probably lay in elementary
534,m02-109-06 neurosis and not in some eruption from those
534,m02-109-07 deeper layers in the human psyche which are
534,m02-109-08 trans-economic.
535,m02-112-00 So once again the metaphysics were depressing,
535,m02-112-01 and in absolute contrast to the physical display.
535,m02-112-02 Mos have an un-American love of parades, and
535,m02-112-03 these young ones, on parade for jobs which they
535,m02-112-04 had to get to pay off their college bills, were naturally
535,m02-112-05 putting their best foot forward.
536,m03-006-00 'Something's up,' said Lord Undertone,
536,m03-006-01 carefully casual. 'The servants are all on
536,m03-006-02 edge... did you notice? And the mules
536,m03-006-03 didn't seem to want to get off the raft.'
536,m03-006-04 He peered as it were into the dark secrets
536,m03-006-05 of the jungle. 'Think there's Indians
536,m03-006-06 about?' It was most certainly an eerie
536,m03-006-07 night, exceptionally brilliant and strange,
536,m03-006-08 for in the proximity of the mountains,
536,m03-006-09 whose presence I could almost smell,
537,m03-013-00 'Impressive,' Lord Undertone said, gazing reverently
537,m03-013-01 on the cosmic handiwork. 'All those stars. But I'm
537,m03-013-02 a bit earthbound tonight, Trout. I've got a queer
537,m03-013-03 feeling, like I always get when something
537,m03-013-04 sensational's going to happen. There's things lurking
537,m03-013-05 if you ask me. Might be jaguar, might be...
537,m03-013-06 head-shrinkers.
538,m03-020-00 Hope I die kind of composed, Trout. I mean you can't
538,m03-020-01 imagine the Christian martyrs twisting and shrieking,
538,m03-020-02 no matter how bad it felt, the fire you know, or a
538,m03-020-03 lion munching, or arrows where it hurts most. Or
538,m03-020-04 can you. Look over there.' He pointed to the
538,m03-020-05 shadows beyond the river. 'Something moved.'
539,m03-033-00 'Bottle-Foot, my lord.' 'Bottle-Foot?' His lordship
539,m03-033-01 may have thought I had become unbalanced
539,m03-033-02 through fear. 'A character Mr Gilberto mentioned
539,m03-033-03 to other day, my lord. A being of whom
539,m03-033-04 the forest Indians are said to be mortally
539,m03-033-05 afraid, with a hoof shaped like the heel
539,m03-033-06 of a bottle. If your lordship will excuse me
539,m03-033-07 a moment...'
542,m03-110-00 Sally and of course Mrs Septimus, for surely
542,m03-110-01 Mr Septimus stood in the same case as
542,m03-110-02 myself? But was it so? I allowed myself
542,m03-110-03 to entertain for an instant the idea, the
542,m03-110-04 strange, the unwelcome, the almost
542,m03-110-05 inconceivable idea, that Ariadne's arrival
542,m03-110-06 would be inopportune; and with the idea came
542,m03-110-07 a somewhat vulgar impulse, which I refused,
542,m03-110-08 to watch Mr Septimus more closely, Mrs
542,m03-110-09 Caine too and Mr Gilberto who would ...
542,m03-114-00 But all three were to the casual
542,m03-114-01 observation I permitted myself unruffled;
542,m03-114-02 Mr Septimus reserved and certainly very
542,m03-114-03 thoughtful, but that was his habit. Indeed
542,m03-114-04 we were all invaded by a most tranquil
542,m03-114-05 mood. Even the Indian servants relaxed, knowing,
542,m03-114-06 so Mr Gilberto told us, that the wild and
542,m03-114-07 savage tribes never approached this region: at
542,m03-114-08 any rate they remained with us, perhaps
542,m03-114-09 for such protection as our presence, or Mrs
543,m03-118-00 But after what Mrs Caine had said it was never
543,m03-118-01 far from our minds that at any moment we were
543,m03-118-02 to receive a summons. I could see that Mr Septimus
543,m03-118-03 was impatient for it. This afternoon, then, we climbed
543,m03-118-04 a promontory, a mass of clean rock crowned with
543,m03-118-05 trees and bushes, that stood well out over the lake.
545,m04-030-00 "Good-bye, Dai," said Morfydd, smiling from the bottom step.
545,m04-030-01 "Good-bye, Morfydd." He sought to enfold her in his arms. But he was too late.
545,m04-030-02 She was already up the bus steps, and the bus was away. And Morfydd Owen
545,m04-030-03 waving, unkissed, from the window. And Dai, on the pavement, knowing in his
545,m04-030-04 heart that Morfydd was leaving him as surely as she was leaving Dinas.
545,m04-038-00 So the bus set out for Llangrwl. But it never reached there! Somewhere,
545,m04-038-01 on those fifteen miles of mountain roads, it disappeared from the earthly
545,m04-038-02 scene. The first intimation that all was not well came when a
545,m04-038-03 Mr. Isaiah Roberts, landlord of The Traveller's Joy, rang up the
545,m04-038-04 Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. to ask what had happened to their
545,m04-038-05 damn bus.
545,m04-043-00 "Left here all right," said Ifor. "Two-thirty-five, on the dot." "It's
545,m04-043-01 supposed to leave at two-twenty." "Who says so?" "Your timetable."
545,m04-043-02 "Don't want to take too much notice of those old timetables," Ifor said,
545,m04-043-03 reasonably. "Start running punctual and where are you? People get
545,m04-043-04 left behind, isn't it? Very exasperating for one and all."
545,m04-061-00 "And what are you going to do about it?" Tendentious, Mr. Roberts sounded.
545,m04-061-01 "What do you want me to do? Send out a sheriff's posse, is it?" No sense
545,m04-061-02 of humour, that Isaiah. He banged down the receiver. Very uncivil. Dropped
545,m04-061-03 the mask, now, Ifor did. "Dai Pugh," he bellowed. "Leap on your bicycle
545,m04-061-04 and scour the countryside between here and The Traveller's Joy.
546,m04-072-00 The two-twenty to Llangrwl has failed to
546,m04-072-01 complete her mission." Paled, did Dai. For the
546,m04-072-02 two-twenty carried, for him, a cargo more
546,m04-072-03 precious than jewels. Though Mofydd Owen
546,m04-072-04 was, as he feared, departed out of his life,
546,m04-072-05 he still loved her dearly. Already, even
546,m04-072-06 as with trembling fingers he fastened his
546,m04-072-07 trouser clips, he was seeing her lying in
546,m04-072-08 some dreadful ravine, or beset by
546,m04-072-09 robbers, or being whisked off to Emergency
546,m04-072-10 Ward 10.
546,m04-078-00 But even his imagination, luckily for him,
546,m04-078-01 did not visualise the awful truth - that
546,m04-078-02 Morfyyd Owen was already qualifying for
546,m04-078-03 the title of "First Woman to Enter Space."
546,m04-078-04 "Where are we going, Mam?" inquired little
546,m04-078-05 Cadwallader when his child mind grasped
546,m04-078-06 the fact that the green earth was falling
546,m04-078-07 away at a rate of knots.
546,m04-081-00 Where indeed? Megan Thomas spoke sharply
546,m04-081-01 to the conductor, demanding an explanation.
546,m04-081-02 But nonplussed, the conductor was. A
546,m04-081-03 good man, mind; knew his job. But out of
546,m04-081-04 depth in this particular instance. Fingered
546,m04-081-05 his ticket-punch nervously. Peered out of
546,m04-081-06 the window. Went and consulted the driver.
546,m04-081-07 "Where are we going?" he echoed Cadwallader.
546,m04-081-08 "Damned if I know, boy," said the driver.
546,m04-081-09 "But something very untoward has
546,m04-081-10 happened, if you ask me."
546,m04-093-00 Immersed in the Dinas Advertiser, was the
546,m04-093-01 Rev. Edwards. Now he put down his paper,
546,m04-093-02 folded it, and glanced idly out of the
546,m04-093-03 window. Looked again, eyes starting from
546,m04-093-04 his head. "God bless my immortal soul,"
546,m04-093-05 he cried. "Never mind your immortal
546,m04-093-06 soul," said Megan Thomas tartly.
546,m04-093-07 "Here we are traversing the heavens at the
546,m04-093-08 very moment when we should be
546,m04-093-09 running into Llangrwl bus station.
546,m04-100-00 And no one doing the first thing about
546,m04-100-01 it." Stung, the conductor was. "What you
546,m04-100-02 expect me to do?" he inquired, bitter.
546,m04-100-03 "Radio Flying Control at London Airport,
546,m04-100-04 is it?" "Mutual recriminations will get
546,m04-100-05 us nowhere," boomed the Rev. Edwards.
546,m04-100-06 "It's all very well," commented
546,m04-100-07 Mr. Hayball from the back seat.
547,m04-107-00 "But Eth and me wanted to be
547,m04-107-01 at the Youth Hostel before dark."
547,m04-107-02 Morfydd Owen was silent. But she
547,m04-107-03 looked down at the fast-disappearing
547,m04-107-04 earth, and it seemed to her that she
547,m04-107-05 would never see her Dai again. And
547,m04-107-06 though half an hour ago she had
547,m04-107-07 regarded this possibility with
547,m04-107-08 fortitude, it now filled her with
547,m04-107-09 dismay. Quietly she began to
547,m04-107-10 weep...
547,m04-113-00 Dai, meanwhile, was pedalling
547,m04-113-01 furiously on the road. Not a sign of
547,m04-113-02 the bus. He passed The Traveller's
547,m04-113-03 Joy. At last he caught up Mr. Roberts,
547,m04-113-04 walking very dogged towards Llangrwl.
547,m04-113-05 "Afternoon, Mr. Roberts," he called, polite,
547,m04-113-06 as he shot past. His spirits were rising.
547,m04-113-07 He had seen no sign of an accident.
547,m04-113-08 Therefore Mr. Roberts must have been mistaken.
547,m04-113-09 He would find the bus safe and sound in
547,m04-113-10 Llangrwl, and his dear Morfydd quietly
547,m04-123-00 But disappointment awaited him. A
547,m04-123-01 restive queue of people in the bus station,
547,m04-123-02 waiting to be transported to Dinas. And
547,m04-123-03 when he went to Morfydd's house, all
547,m04-123-04 he found was Morfydd's mam, working
547,m04-123-05 herself up proper... Getting dark, now.
547,m04-123-06 The conductor switched on the lights.
547,m04-123-07 The beleaguered passengers peered out of
547,m04-123-08 the windows. Little to be seen, only a
547,m04-123-09 few lone stars, and the distant earth
547,m04-123-10 brooding in her shroud of mist.
547,m04-131-00 Megan Thomas sat tight-lipped, nursing
547,m04-131-01 the sleeping Cadwallader. Driver and
547,m04-131-02 conductor peered ahead into nothingness.
547,m04-131-03 On the back seat Stan Hayball embraced
547,m04-131-04 his Eth. Morfydd thought of Dai. The
547,m04-131-05 Rev. Edwards, standing at the front,
547,m04-131-06 looked at his forlorn flock. "What
547,m04-131-07 about a verse or two of Cwm Rhondda?"
547,m04-131-08 he suggested hopefully.
547,m04-138-00 They looked at him, sullen. His heart
547,m04-138-01 sank. If the Welsh found the situation
547,m04-138-02 too desperate for singing, then the
547,m04-138-03 situation, he realised, must be desperate
547,m04-138-04 indeed. But suddenly they were roused
547,m04-138-05 from their lethargy. Something was
547,m04-138-06 approaching, faster, faster, a tearing
547,m04-138-07 hurrying blur that was past and gone
547,m04-138-08 in a moment, followed by a great
547,m04-138-09 rush of sound. They waved frantically.
550,m04-231-00 "Do as I say, driver." Very stern, the reverend
550,m04-231-01 gentleman was. So the driver peep-peeped as
550,m04-231-02 through empty space. "Thank you," the Rev.
550,m04-231-03 Edwards said courteously. "Secondly, we must
550,m04-231-04 pool and ration our supplies of food, if any."
550,m04-231-05 He looked at Price the Provisions, who was nursing
550,m04-231-06 a great basket.
550,m04-238-00 "Now, who has any food?" he asked hopefully.
550,m04-238-01 Stared back did Price the Provisions, unwinking.
550,m04-238-02 "Mr. Price, I think you may be able to help us here,"
550,m04-238-03 said the Rev. Edwards. Price shook his head.
550,m04-238-04 "Intended for Plas Newydd, this lot is. Paid for,
550,m04-238-05 too." He folded his arms protectively over the basket.
550,m04-246-00 Mutinous dog, thought the Rev. Edwards, who hadn't
550,m04-246-01 enjoyed himself so much since reading Treasure
550,m04-246-02 Island. "What have you got in that basket, Price?"
550,m04-246-03 he roared. Quelled, Mr. Price pulled out a grocery
550,m04-246-04 list, pushed his glasses up on his nose, and
550,m04-246-05 began to read. "Six loaves, four pounds butter,
550,m04-246-06 two pounds marge, one tin pineapple, one York ham."
552,m06-031-00 'But we -' 'Stop your stupid talk, woman!' 'We are -'
552,m06-031-01 'Be silent, woman, and listen,' Band Appa Bondi said.
552,m06-031-02 'We know much,' repeated the Chief Captive. 'Some
552,m06-031-03 things we will tell you. All who make the journey from
552,m06-031-04 the Heavy World become changed. Some die. Most live
552,m06-031-05 and grow wings. Between the worlds are many strong
552,m06-031-06 rays, not seen or felt, which change our bodies.
552,m06-042-00 When you come here, when you come to the True
552,m06-042-01 World, you become a true human. The grub of the
552,m06-042-02 tigerfly is not a tigerfly until it changes. So humans
552,m06-042-03 change.' 'I cannot know what he says,' Haris said
552,m06-042-04 stubbornly, throwing himself down. But Lily-yo and
552,m06-042-05 Flor were listening.
552,m06-048-00 'To this True World, as you call it, we come to die,'
552,m06-048-01 Lily-yo said, doubtingly. The Captive with the
552,m06-048-02 fleshless jaw said, 'The grub of the tigerfly thinks
552,m06-048-03 it dies when it changes into a tigerfly.' 'You are still
552,m06-048-04 young,' said the Chief Captive. 'You begin newly here.
552,m06-048-05 Where are your souls?' Lily-yo and Flor looked at
552,m06-048-06 each other. In their flight from the 4wiltmilt they had
552,m06-048-07 heedlessly thrown down their souls.
552,m06-056-00 Haris had trampled on his. It was unthinkable!
552,m06-056-01 'You see. You needed them no more. You are still
552,m06-056-02 young. You may be able to have babies. Some of those
552,m06-056-03 babies may be born with wings.' The Captive with
552,m06-056-04 the boneless arms added, 'Some may be born wrong,
552,m06-056-05 as we are. Some may be born right.'
552,m06-067-00 'You are too foul to live!' Haris growled. 'Why are
552,m06-067-01 you not killed?' 'Because we know all things,' the
552,m06-067-02 Chief Captive said. Suddenly his second head roused
552,m06-067-03 itself and declared, 'To be a good shape is not all
552,m06-067-04 in life. To know is also good. Because we cannot move
552,m06-067-05 well we can - think. This tribe of the True World
552,m06-067-06 is good and knows these things.
552,m06-076-00 So it lets us rule it.' Flor and Lily-yo
552,m06-076-01 muttered together. 'Do you say that you poor
552,m06-076-02 Captives rule the True World?' Lily-yo asked
552,m06-076-03 at last. 'We do.' 'Then why are you captives?'
552,m06-076-04 The flyman with ear lobes and thumbs connected,
552,m06-076-05 making his perpetual little gesture of protest,
552,m06-076-06 spoke for the first time.
552,m06-083-00 'To rule is to serve, woman. Those who bear power
552,m06-083-01 are slaves to it. Only an outcast is free. Because
552,m06-083-02 we are Captives, we have the time to talk and
552,m06-083-03 think and plan and know. Those who know
552,m06-083-04 command the knives of others.' 'No hurt will
552,m06-083-05 come to you, Lily-yo,' Band Appa Bondi added.
552,m06-083-06 'You will live among us and enjoy your life free
552,m06-083-07 from harm.'
552,m06-091-00 'No!' the Chief Captive said with both mouths.
552,m06-091-01 'Before she can enjoy, Lily-yo and her companion
552,m06-091-02 Flor - this other man creature is plainly useless -
552,m06-091-03 must help our great plan.' 'The invasion?' Bondi
552,m06-091-04 asked. 'What else? Flor and Lily-yo, you arrive
552,m06-091-05 here at a good time. Memories of the Heavy World
552,m06-091-06 and its savage life are still fresh in you.
552,m06-098-00 We need such memories. So we ask you to go
552,m06-098-01 back there on a great plan we have.' 'Go back?'
552,m06-098-02 gasped Flor. 'Yes. We plan to attack the Heavy
552,m06-098-03 World. You must help to lead our force.' The long
552,m06-098-04 afternoon of eternity wore on, that long golden road
552,m06-098-05 of an afternoon that would somewhere lead to
552,m06-098-06 everlasting night.
552,m06-106-00 Motion there was, but motion without event - except
552,m06-106-01 for those negligible events that seemed so large to
552,m06-106-02 the creatures participating in them. For Lily-yo, Flor
552,m06-106-03 and Haris there were many events. Chief of these was
552,m06-106-04 that they learned to fly properly. The pains associated
552,m06-106-05 with their wings soon died away as the wonderful
552,m06-106-06 new flesh and tendon strengthened. To sail up in the
552,m06-106-07 light gravity became an increasing delight - the ugly
552,m06-106-08 flopping movements of flymen on the Heavy World
552,m06-106-09 had no place here.
553,n01-000-00 Alastair was a bachelor. All his life he had
553,n01-000-01 been inclined to regard women as something
553,n01-000-02 which must necessarily be subordinated to his
553,n01-000-03 career. Now he realised that he was entrusting not only
553,n01-000-04 his own life, but Geoffrey's as well, to a strange girl
553,n01-000-05 whom he had never met and on whom after no more
553,n01-000-06 than a couple of telephone calls he was
553,n01-000-07 prepared to place complete reliance.
554,n01-004-00 It was a novel experience. Alastair was
554,n01-004-01 quite unable to explain why he should feel
554,n01-004-02 so much confidence in her. Once again
554,n01-004-03 she checked back her instructions. It was
554,n01-004-04 obvious that she did not fail to appreciate the
554,n01-004-05 faith which he was placing in her and
554,n01-004-06 was prepared to accept the responsibility.
553,n01-009-00 "Good luck, Air Marshal," she said gently. "I'll
553,n01-009-01 be waiting for you at the Hotel Roma at six this
553,n01-009-02 evening - and I shall look forward to meeting you
553,n01-009-03 both at midnight." They might have been
553,n01-009-04 arranging a supper party. Then she rang off.
553,n01-009-05 Alastair admitted that never in a not altogether
553,n01-009-06 uneventful life had he come across a girl who
553,n01-009-07 sounded so charming and appeared to be so
553,n01-009-08 efficient.
555,n01-020-00 For some reason the orderlies had forgotten
555,n01-020-01 to switch on the lights; there was no colour -
555,n01-020-02 physical features were distinguishable solely by
555,n01-020-03 gradations of silvery greyness. Even the snow-
555,n01-020-04 capped summit of Mont Blanc, seven miles
555,n01-020-05 below, was not recognisable among the host
555,n01-020-06 of lower peaks. The screen of the air-to-air
555,n01-020-07 radar glowed. Occasionally minute spots
555,n01-020-08 flickered across its surface, but there was
555,n01-020-09 no permanent image.
555,n01-031-00 In the exceptional clarity he was even able to
555,n01-031-01 make a direct comparison between the radar
555,n01-031-02 image and the ground itself. Ahead lay the
555,n01-031-03 Plain of Lombardy; to the right, Turin; to the
555,n01-031-04 left, Milan. The directional angle of the
555,n01-031-05 scanner could be adjusted to cover any
555,n01-031-06 particular area within its range. Geoffrey
555,n01-031-07 turned the scale slowly to cover the
555,n01-031-08 ground immediately ahead.
556,n01-036-00 He was able to pick out towns, unrecognisable to the
556,n01-036-01 naked eye, obscured by the ground haze which even
556,n01-036-02 on the clearest night limited angular vision. He glanced
556,n01-036-03 at the speed recorder. It seemed almost incredible that
556,n01-036-04 the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle
556,n01-036-05 was resting could really mean hundreds of knots.
555,n01-045-00 Now, as Alastair reduced the thrust, the
555,n01-045-01 pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft
555,n01-045-02 dipped slightly. The needle of the speed
555,n01-045-03 recorder swung gently through 8.0, 7.0, 6.0
555,n01-045-04 before coming to rest at 5.0. "We're a bit
555,n01-045-05 ahead of time," said Alastair. "We'll run
555,n01-045-06 in on minimum engine power." Geoffrey
555,n01-045-07 smiled. Alastair talked of running in when
555,n01-045-08 they were still more than four hundred
555,n01-045-09 miles from their destination.
557,n01-052-00 They were nearing Modena. Geoffrey focused the radar scanner
557,n01-052-01 on the bridge over the Po, barely forty miles to port.
557,n01-052-02 He was able to trace the course of the river; he
557,n01-052-03 thought he could recognise the route of N12,
557,n01-052-04 along which he had motored so desperately little
557,n01-052-05 more than twenty-four hours earlier. Since then
557,n01-052-06 he had flown to England, attended the vital
557,n01-052-07 conference in Bruce Denton's office, been whisked
557,n01-052-08 by special helicopter from the Horse Guards
557,n01-052-09 Parade to Boscombe Down, slept for six blessed
557,n01-052-10 refreshing hours and had now completed two-thirds
557,n01-052-11 of the journey back to the place where every
557,n01-052-12 indication pointed to Eve being held.
558,n01-057-00 Geoffrey set himself to consider the
558,n01-057-01 movements of the Bentley. It had passed
558,n01-057-02 him at the temporary bridge over the
558,n01-057-03 Tartaro at a few minutes past ten on the
558,n01-057-04 previous night. He worked out the distance
558,n01-057-05 on the presumption that its route had been
558,n01-057-06 through Florence and Rome and then
558,n01-057-07 across Italy via Foggia to Barletta.
558,n01-057-08 It came to just over six hundred
558,n01-057-09 miles.
560,n02-004-00 To Beryl, at least, this was anti-climax with a
560,n02-004-01 vengeance. She had expected to be met with violent
560,n02-004-02 reproaches - and here he was bland and smiling.
560,n02-004-03 But it did not take her long to realise that his mood
560,n02-004-04 was less pleasant than appeared on the surface.
560,n02-004-05 He told her nonchalantly, as he led the way to his
560,n02-004-06 own veranda, that he had taken the liberty of
560,n02-004-07 asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -
560,n02-004-08 to come over and make the presentation in her stead.
560,n02-009-00 "I caught him just as he was going to the
560,n02-009-01 airport to meet Blanche," he said. "As a matter
560,n02-009-02 of fact I'd asked him last night to deputise
560,n02-009-03 for me and fetch her. He brought her to the party
560,n02-009-04 too. They're both here." "I didn't know she was
560,n02-009-05 coming back from Barbados so soon." Beryl
560,n02-009-06 said the first thing that came into her head.
561,n02-028-00 Jack and Blanche were quick to sympathise, and to
561,n02-028-01 express their disgust at Sir John's abominable treatment
561,n02-028-02 of his guests. But Piers remained aloof, and when Beryl
561,n02-028-03 suggested having a second party, the following week, he
561,n02-028-04 poured cold water on the project. Everyone, he declared,
561,n02-028-05 had had a thoroughly good time, and it would take them
561,n02-028-06 nearly to next week to settle down again. Meanwhile
561,n02-028-07 Hubert would have betaken himself and his well-
561,n02-028-08 earned gratuity to his native village at the
561,n02-028-09 north of the island.
562,n02-033-00 It was all over and done with.
562,n02-033-01 For the time being Beryl was content to let
562,n02-033-02 it go at that, but she resolved to have
562,n02-033-03 it out with Piers when a reasonable
562,n02-033-04 opportunity presented itself. He must
562,n02-033-05 learn that he could not treat her
562,n02-033-06 with injustice and contempt, ignoring
562,n02-033-07 her explanations as though he were
562,n02-033-08 a schoolmaster and she a small,
562,n02-033-09 ignorant child.
562,n02-037-00 He gave her no chance of any private
562,n02-037-01 conversation that evening, for when
562,n02-037-02 Blanche and Jack left, he went with
562,n02-037-03 them. But next morning she insisted
562,n02-037-04 on his taking her out in the jeep -
562,n02-037-05 to find, if possible, Hubert and his
562,n02-037-06 relations, and tell them of
562,n02-037-07 her great disappointment at being
562,n02-037-08 held up in Balicou.
563,n02-040-00 With an air of resignation he sent Judy, his
563,n02-040-01 Boxer, to the back, and made room for her
563,n02-040-02 beside him. "Is that all you want to do?"
563,n02-040-03 he asked, letting in the clutch. "No; I want
563,n02-040-04 to make you understand just what happened
563,n02-040-05 about this Balicou trip," she returned
563,n02-040-06 coldly. "I'm a little tired of being treated
563,n02-040-07 like an ineffective imbecile."
563,n02-045-00 "And I'm heartily sick of being constantly called
563,n02-045-01 to account for my manners," he retorted.
563,n02-045-02 "What have I done wrong now? I cover up for
563,n02-045-03 you the best way I can by getting hold of Jack
563,n02-045-04 to make the presentation, I run the damned
563,n02-045-05 party to the best of my ability - saying the
563,n02-045-06 sugary things you ought to have been there
563,n02-045-07 to say - and all you can do is to find
563,n02-045-08 fault."
561,n02-049-00 "It's your superior attitude that riles me." Beryl was
561,n02-049-01 scarlet with annoyance. "How I happened to be marooned
561,n02-049-02 at Balicou doesn't interest you in the faintest degree. You
561,n02-049-03 look as though it was only what you expected of me,
561,n02-049-04 as though I didn't care a hoot about letting Hubert
561,n02-049-05 and his pals down."
564,n02-054-00 "As your employee it's not my business
564,n02-054-01 to understand all the whys and
564,n02-054-02 wherefores of your actions," he said
564,n02-054-03 stiffly. "Still less to criticise you."
564,n02-054-04 "Oh, drop that nonsense, Piers!
564,n02-054-05 Be yourself," she exclaimed, with
564,n02-054-06 mounting exasperation. "Very well!" He
564,n02-054-07 brought the jeep to a standstill in a rough
564,n02-054-08 path fringed and shaded by citrus trees.
564,n02-054-09 "If you want my true opinion I'll give it.
565,n02-062-00 You made some sort of a protest to Graybury.
565,n02-062-01 I'll give you credit for that. But you didn't press
565,n02-062-02 the matter because, very naturally, you were
565,n02-062-03 thoroughly enjoying Forrest's company in
565,n02-062-04 idyllic surroundings." "How dare you say
565,n02-062-05 such a thing?" she blazed. "For goodness'
565,n02-062-06 sake show a glimmer of reason," was his
565,n02-062-07 equally indignant rejoinder.
315,n02-104-00 "I know. Absurd as it may seem, I didn't want
315,n02-104-01 you to think badly of me." She turned away
315,n02-104-02 from him to fondle Judy, who, sensing something
315,n02-104-03 amiss, was nudging her in the endeavour to
315,n02-104-04 gain her attention. "The truth is that
315,n02-104-05 if I had absolutely insisted on sailing at the
315,n02-104-06 time originally arranged, Sir John would
315,n02-104-07 have had it in for Guy.
315,n02-109-00 You see, it was, apparently, through a mistake
315,n02-109-01 on Guy's part that we missed seeing the
315,n02-109-02 flamingoes our first morning on the island."
315,n02-109-03 "What harm could possibly have come to Forrest
315,n02-109-04 through Sir John's nonsense?" Piers could
315,n02-109-05 hardly have spoken with more contempt.
315,n02-109-06 A bully like that respects anyone who
315,n02-109-07 dares to stand up to him."
315,n02-114-00 Beryl tried to suppress the thought that this was
315,n02-114-01 precisely the remark she had made to Guy.
315,n02-114-02 She said icily, "As you pride yourself on
315,n02-114-03 your knowledge of all the affairs of the
315,n02-114-04 island I needn't tell you that Sir John
315,n02-114-05 Graybury is one of Mr. Hewson's most
315,n02-114-06 important customers." "So what? You're not
315,n02-114-07 trying to say that Hewson would victimise
315,n02-114-08 Forrest for behaving with ordinary moral
315,n02-114-09 courage!
315,n02-120-00 He's quite capable of telling Sir John to take
315,n02-120-01 himself and his business to an unmention-
315,n02-120-02 able destination." "There's a difference
315,n02-120-03 between what a senior and a junior
315,n02-120-04 partner can do," was her quick reply.
315,n02-120-05 "What they can bring off! I'll admit that.
315,n02-120-06 But Forrest might at least have tried. He's
315,n02-120-07 pretty spineless!"
315,n02-127-00 "You think you could have carried more weight
315,n02-127-01 with Sir John?" she enquired cuttingly.
315,n02-127-02 "For all your good opinion of yourself,
315,n02-127-03 I doubt it. He's about as easy to push around
315,n02-127-04 as - as a grounded whale!" He had to smile
315,n02-127-05 at that, but went on airily, "I'd have made
315,n02-127-06 an attempt to show my lady-love that I
315,n02-127-07 put her interests before my own.
568,n02-151-00 Their air of smiling somnolence showed them
568,n02-151-01 to have been guests at yesterday's
568,n02-151-02 celebrations, and their friendly welcome
568,n02-151-03 and warm sympathy, as she explained
568,n02-151-04 how she had come to miss the party,
568,n02-151-05 made her send a complacent glance
568,n02-151-06 in Piers' direction. What a fuss-box the
568,n02-151-07 man was, she thought impatiently,
568,n02-151-08 trying to worry her into the belief
568,n02-151-09 that her failure to appear at a function
568,n02-151-10 on the estate was a major error:
569,n02-154-00 And then she received a jolt. Old Hubert, standing
569,n02-154-01 beside her, his battered hat in his hand, his
569,n02-154-02 toothless mouth stretched in a wide grin, told her
569,n02-154-03 in halting 6patois that "3Mistah Piers" had
569,n02-154-04 explained right at the start that "3Mis' Beryl"
569,n02-154-05 would be 3"plenty, plenty sad" not to be back
569,n02-154-06 at the Villa in time.
570,n02-157-00 That it wouldn't be her fault at all. That
570,n02-157-01 she was a lady who, like her Uncle Charles,
570,n02-157-02 took the highest pride in keeping her word. "I
570,n02-157-03 could see 3anudder 3t'ing," he went on in a
570,n02-157-04 lower voice, his sunken black eyes twinkling.
570,n02-157-05 3"He powerful anxious, poor Mistah Piers.
570,n02-157-06 We all know how Balicou Island dangerous
570,n02-157-07 to all kin' o' boats, wid d'ose big, big
570,n02-157-08 rocks in an' out o' de water.
571,n03-038-00 He had almost entirely settled back into his old
571,n03-038-01 ways, even to reading law about two hours each
571,n03-038-02 day. Though he did not refuse wine, which the
571,n03-038-03 judge always had on the table at dinner, he
571,n03-038-04 did not act as though he found it necessary
571,n03-038-05 except in moderate compliance with his father's
571,n03-038-06 habit.
572,n03-064-00 Around that rounded rocky promontory where the
572,n03-064-01 white spray could be seen flying across the distance
572,n03-064-02 of a mile and a half, came the yawl under her full
572,n03-064-03 triangular sail, and to the judge's frightened eyes, so
572,n03-064-04 close to the rocks that it would be dashed
572,n03-064-05 against them with the lift of the next wave.
573,n03-066-00 "That boy! That damned fool boy! What does he mean
573,n03-066-01 by trying to come home now, even if he did promise?
573,n03-066-02 What does time mean when weighed against the life of
573,n03-066-03 two human beings?" Not until he was certain that the
573,n03-066-04 yawl had rounded the rocky point instead of
573,n03-066-05 being flung against the huge boulders did the judge
573,n03-066-06 empty his lungs of stifling air and refill them
573,n03-066-07 with part of that howling northwest gale.
577,n03-097-00 "My God!" the judge cried out. "The boy
577,n03-097-01 is going to try to make a landing on the
577,n03-097-02 weather side of that pier! He'll wreck!"
577,n03-097-03 Willie Kim was speechless, only his slant
577,n03-097-04 black eyes showing any emotion. With a
577,n03-097-05 quick shift of tiller, and at the same time
577,n03-097-06 jibbing the boom to which he had the
577,n03-097-07 stay rope fastened, Bill made the
577,n03-097-08 yawl recover.
577,n03-103-00 It seemed to the frightened judge
577,n03-103-01 as though his son would actually
577,n03-103-02 shoot the craft in under the outer
577,n03-103-03 end of the wharf. But by pressing
577,n03-103-04 the tiller hard over and at the
577,n03-103-05 same time dropping the small sheet
577,n03-103-06 of wet canvas, Bill cleared the
577,n03-103-07 corner of the pier by inches, and
577,n03-103-08 with the tiller still hard over, brought
577,n03-103-09 the yawl up against the waves
578,n03-106-00 "Willie," the judge said huskily,
578,n03-106-01 "that was as pretty a piece of seamans-
578,n03-106-02 hip as I ever saw. That boy of
578,n03-106-03 mine seems to know how to do
578,n03-106-04 everything, when he wants to."
578,n03-106-05 "3Naw," disputed Willie. 3"Just
578,n03-106-06 play in damn fine luck this time.
578,n03-106-07 He plenty smart though." As they
578,n03-106-08 reached the pier, the judge on legs
578,n03-106-09 that were a little unsteady, they
578,n03-106-10 found Bueno Buck, now on the
578,n03-106-11 pier, leading the yawl toward
579,n03-113-00 "Hello, Dad!" Bill called. "I hope you
579,n03-113-01 weren't worried. We're going to
579,n03-113-02 drag the boat ashore and turn
579,n03-113-03 her over. She has a foot of
579,n03-113-04 water in her. I wouldn't be
579,n03-113-05 surprised if we broke all
579,n03-113-06 speed records on the way in.
579,n03-113-07 Yes sir, I am slightly wet, and
579,n03-113-08 Buck would be wetter if he
579,n03-113-09 had more clothes on."
580,n03-120-00 With four doing the job and the waves
580,n03-120-01 pushing at the stern, the yawl was soon
580,n03-120-02 dragged out but before it was turned
580,n03-120-03 over Bueno Buck reached into the foot
580,n03-120-04 of water, tossed out a string of silvery
580,n03-120-05 lake trout and said - 3"Bill, he's better
580,n03-120-06 man at catch 'em than Injun, Judge.
580,n03-120-07 You look. Little one more as fifteen
580,n03-120-08 inches. Maybe big one four feet,
580,n03-120-09 huh?"
581,n03-126-00 "By George, that is a beautiful string of fish!"
581,n03-126-01 exclaimed the judge. "Toss them on the grass
581,n03-126-02 and then we'll all get hold and heave." A
581,n03-126-03 few moments later the yawl was upside
581,n03-126-04 down, exposing its shallow keel.
550,n04-000-00 Bertram's face was grim. "You think it was the Snort,
550,n04-000-01 don't you?" John gave a short laugh. "I did," he
550,n04-000-02 said; "but I'd better stop thinking that now.
550,n04-000-03 Pericles is fitted with an identically similar one."
550,n04-000-04 "So there you are, my dear." Peggy's eyes filled
550,n04-000-05 with tears. "It's so unfair," she said.
550,n04-009-00 "That little beast Robbie Munyard spent six
550,n04-009-01 months ashore while Pericles was refitting in the
550,n04-009-02 dockyard and now that she's ready for sea he goes
550,n04-009-03 sick. Just because he's an Honourable he can do
550,n04-009-04 what he likes. Anyway, why pick on you to succeed
550,n04-009-05 him?" John didn't answer. There was no point
550,n04-009-06 in sharing his discomfort with Peggy.
583,n04-048-00 So he put up for the night at The Admiral's Head, that
583,n04-048-01 famous Portsmouth hostelry, second only in historic
583,n04-048-02 interest to The George, unhappily destroyed by German
583,n04-048-03 bombs during the last war. Having deposited his
583,n04-048-04 baggage and unpacked his overnight-bag he
583,n04-048-05 went in search of a drink. The lower bar was
583,n04-048-06 empty, save for the lady known by all habitue
583,n04-048-07 *?2s as 'Seaweed', and a youngish, sharp-eyed
583,n04-048-08 man who was staring moodily into a gin
583,n04-048-09 and tonic.
583,n04-052-00 Seaweed's memory was prodigious; her manner
583,n04-052-01 must have been worth a great deal to the proprietors
583,n04-052-02 of the hotel. She greeted John, however, with less
583,n04-052-03 than her usual cordiality and flashed a warning
583,n04-052-04 glance at him. Evidently the other occupant
583,n04-052-05 of the bar was not 6persona grata. If her
583,n04-052-06 memory was good, so was this stranger's.
583,n04-052-07 "You're Commander Winter," he said. "Have a
583,n04-052-08 gin?" He turned to Seaweed -
583,n04-060-00 "Make it a large one, darling. I know the naval
583,n04-060-01 habits. 'Drink gin and call each other wallahs,
583,n04-060-02 what!' - as the Guards officer said on his return
583,n04-060-03 from a visit to the Royal Navy. Submarines, what.
583,n04-060-04 Youngest D.S.C. in the war, what? Crawled
583,n04-060-05 inside a submarine casing to defuse a Jerry
583,n04-060-06 bomb. Should have been a V.C.
583,n04-068-00 What are you waiting for, darling? The officer is
583,n04-068-01 obviously thirsty." John fought back his
583,n04-068-02 inherited desire to snub the man. If he did he
583,n04-068-03 would have to leave the bar and either sit in
583,n04-068-04 the lounge or return to his bedroom.
583,n04-068-05 Seaweed sensed his embarrassment and
583,n04-068-06 came to the rescue. "You haven't introduced
583,n04-068-07 yourself," she said with mock severity.
583,n04-075-00 "It's a rule on these premises. No treating with
583,n04-075-01 strangers - that's right, John, isn't it?" "My
583,n04-075-02 fault entirely," said the stranger. "It's my conceited
583,n04-075-03 nature - I assumed that you both knew who I
583,n04-075-04 was. I'm Ian Bawley. Does that mean anything
583,n04-075-05 to you?" It did. Ian Bawley's name was
583,n04-075-06 printed at the head of most naval articles
583,n04-075-07 in the Daily Courier.
584,n04-084-00 "Oh, the Press," said Seaweed. "Down here on business, Mr.
584,n04-084-01 Bawley?" "A pressman is always on the job."
584,n04-084-02 He held out his hand and John could not do
584,n04-084-03 otherwise than take it. "Pleased to meet you,
584,n04-084-04 Commander," he said. "Now what about that
584,n04-084-05 drink?" John nodded - he could afford to buy
584,n04-084-06 one in return and he was lonely.
584,n04-092-00 "For the sake of accuracy," he said, "and I
584,n04-092-01 know how you newspaper people value that commodity! -
584,n04-092-02 please don't address me as Commander. I'm
584,n04-092-03 a Lieutenant-Commander. Perhaps we could
584,n04-092-04 drop the rank - such a mouthful!" "You're
584,n04-092-05 absolutely right," said Bawley, as he pushed over
584,n04-092-06 his glass. "Fill it up, darling. Accuracy above
584,n04-092-07 all else. We pride ourselves about accuracy on
584,n04-092-08 the Courier.
584,n04-100-00 Ever known us bowl a wide about your Service?
584,n04-100-01 Check and counter-check - nothing but the truth.
584,n04-100-02 Somewhat embarrassing, what?" "How can the
584,n04-100-03 truth be embarrassing?" John sipped his double
584,n04-100-04 gin with relish. It was his favourite brand,
584,n04-100-05 he was on the verge of a new chapter in
584,n04-100-06 his career, and his companion's attitude was
584,n04-100-07 challenging.
584,n04-107-00 Life at home and in Bath had been a
584,n04-107-01 trifle too comfortable and humdrum.
584,n04-107-02 He'd never before met a pressman and
584,n04-107-03 found him curiously stimulating. "You're a
584,n04-107-04 bit of a humorist, aren't you?" said
584,n04-107-05 Bawley. "The truth is usually very embarra-
584,n04-107-06 ssing. You're in submarines, aren't you?"
584,n04-107-07 "You know a great deal about me,"
584,n04-107-08 said John.
584,n04-114-00 "It's my business. I'll tell you more. You're
584,n04-114-01 going to take over command of Pericles. Am I
584,n04-114-02 right?" "Who told you?" "Little bird.
584,n04-114-03 Other half?" John nodded. "On me." Bawley
584,n04-114-04 shook his head. "All paid for by His Lordship,"
584,n04-114-05 he said. "Expense account. You're a married
584,n04-114-06 man with a couple of kids. Can't go wasting
584,n04-114-07 your substance on a complete stranger. Set
584,n04-114-08 'em up, darling!"
585,n04-130-00 John flushed. "I'm not in need of charity." "Come
585,n04-130-01 off it," said Bawley. "The proprietor of the Daily
585,n04-130-02 Courier knows what's going on. If he doesn't mind,
585,n04-130-03 why should you?" "I see." John took the
585,n04-130-04 refilled glass and looked over the rim at his
585,n04-130-05 companion. "You want me to talk, is that it?"
585,n04-139-00 "You misjudge me," said Bawley. "You have
585,n04-139-01 nothing to tell me, yet. But we'll be meeting
585,n04-139-02 again, no doubt, and then you will have.
585,n04-139-03 Regard this as a softening-up process, and
585,n04-139-04 have dinner with me? On His Lordship,
585,n04-139-05 of course." "On one condition," said John.
585,n04-139-06 "Tell me who the little bird was." "Can't
585,n04-139-07 you guess? Whose portrait appears regularly
585,n04-139-08 in the shiny papers?"
585,n04-149-00 "You mean Munyard?" "Sure. Very useful
585,n04-149-01 contact, is our Robbie; he gives us the gen and
585,n04-149-02 we give him the publicity. 'The Honourable
585,n04-149-03 "Robbie" and friend', what? You know the
585,n04-149-04 sort of thing." "You'll get nothing out of me,"
585,n04-149-05 said John, "but you can pay for my drinks
585,n04-149-06 if you want to, as long as you keep off
585,n04-149-07 Service matters."
585,n04-156-00 "Good-oh! One for the grill-room, darling, and
585,n04-156-01 tell George to bring in the 6carte du jour."
585,n04-156-02 Bawley was a man of his word. He kept
585,n04-156-03 away from Service matters, was an excellent
585,n04-156-04 host and a splendid raconteur. The evening
585,n04-156-05 passed all too quickly. As they parted in
585,n04-156-06 the vestibule the two men were well
585,n04-156-07 disposed towards each other.
585,n04-163-00 "Ever been to Fleet Street?" asked Bawley.
585,n04-163-01 "You should. Next time you're in Town
585,n04-163-02 give me a ring at this number and I'll
585,n04-163-03 take you round the pubs where most
585,n04-163-04 of the work is done." He held out a card.
585,n04-163-05 John took it and put it in his pocket.
585,n04-163-06 "Thanks," he said. "If ever my missus
585,n04-163-07 lets me off the chain I'll take you
585,n04-163-08 up on that.
587,n04-202-00 Glad I met you. Don't forget to give me a ring -
587,n04-202-01 any time - knock twice and ask for Bawley, what?"
587,n04-202-02 "I don't know when that will be," said John.
587,n04-202-03 "I shall be busy for a while, cleaning up after
587,n04-202-04 Master bloody Munyard." THERE were six submarines,
587,n04-202-05 lying in pairs alongside the jetty at Fort Blockhouse.
587,n04-202-06 Black and grimly businesslike they both looked and
587,n04-202-07 sounded, for all of them were rumbling as they
587,n04-202-08 charged their electric batteries.
587,n04-209-00 A light wind wafted the smoke of diesel exhaust in
587,n04-209-01 through the open windows of the Captain's house. It
587,n04-209-02 pervaded every room but neither Harry nor Madeleine
587,n04-209-03 Turton noticed its existence as they sat in silence over
587,n04-209-04 a substantial breakfast. Although usually a very
587,n04-209-05 talkative lady Madeleine respected her husband's
587,n04-209-06 silences, for she knew they betokened a worry of
587,n04-209-07 some sort.
587,n04-213-00 There had been many such breakfasts lately since the
587,n04-213-01 affair of Parsifal. Harry had lost a good deal of weight.
587,n04-213-02 His normal placid and steady-going manner remained,
587,n04-213-03 but she could see that it no longer came naturally.
587,n04-213-04 It is the common lot of all Squadron Senior Officers
587,n04-213-05 to experience such catastrophes as the loss of a submarine,
587,n04-213-06 though in peace time these happenings are few and
587,n04-213-07 far between.
587,n04-218-00 This is the testing time for all. The affair blows up into
587,n04-218-01 a national disaster and then when it is all over life
587,n04-218-02 must continue as before. During this period the Captain
587,n04-218-03 must present an unruffled appearance and carry on as
587,n04-218-04 if nothing unusual has happened. Harry Turton had
587,n04-218-05 written letters to the bereaved, had visited many in the
587,n04-218-06 locality, had been interviewed by the Press, had driven
587,n04-218-07 his surviving submarines a good deal harder than
587,n04-218-08 usual and in fact had applied all the usual specifics
587,n04-218-09 suitable for such occasions.
588,n06-074-00 He rode down to where I was waiting. I was
588,n06-074-01 thinking what a skill he had for reading
588,n06-074-02 my mind. "This would be as good a place
588,n06-074-03 for a hold-up as any," he said, reining in
588,n06-074-04 near me. "Yes," I said. "It'll be here to-
588,n06-074-05 morrow as likely as not." I paused. "Miss
588,n06-074-06 Jeannie'll be on that coach, Dan."
588,n06-082-00 "Yes," he said. "I know." "No harm must come
588,n06-082-01 to her, Dan." "She'll be all right. It's the
588,n06-082-02 men who'll be after that coach I'm interested
588,n06-082-03 in, Johnny." "I know. But if lead starts
588,n06-082-04 flying she might be in danger." "That's so.
588,n06-082-05 But I reckon they'll be too busy shooting at
588,n06-082-06 us to bother with the coach and the folks
588,n06-082-07 in it."
588,n06-092-00 "Maybe," I said. "But we've got to remember
588,n06-092-01 that girl all the time, Dan. I feel kind
588,n06-092-02 of responsible for her." "Of course," he said,
588,n06-092-03 giving me one of his strange looks. Then he
588,n06-092-04 turned the conversation. "Let's ride over
588,n06-092-05 and have a look at the mining camp.
588,n06-092-06 After all it's them we're supposed to be
588,n06-092-07 working for, as well as the townsfolk and
588,n06-092-08 the agency detective."
588,n06-100-00 With something of a start I remembered the
588,n06-100-01 man who'd brought us into this business.
588,n06-100-02 "Maybe you don't know about Appleton,
588,n06-100-03 Dan?" "Know what?" "That he's dead,"
588,n06-100-04 I said. I watched him because I was always
588,n06-100-05 fascinated by the way he looked when you
588,n06-100-06 tried to surprise him. "Dead?" he said. "Yes.
588,n06-100-07 Dead. Shuffled out of the deck. Blasted
588,n06-100-08 down with a shotgun outside the Palace
588,n06-100-09 last night."
588,n06-111-00 "Fenton or Somers," he said. "Or the Town
588,n06-111-01 Marshal," I added. His face was fixed,
588,n06-111-02 unreadable as a rock. "Let's get over to the
588,n06-111-03 mining camp," he said abruptly. He wheeled
588,n06-111-04 his horse back off the trail and up the slope
588,n06-111-05 leading to the ridge. I followed. From the
588,n06-111-06 top you could see something of the wild hill
588,n06-111-07 country that lay all round Gilburg Crossing.
588,n06-119-00 The air was fresh and clear and you
588,n06-119-01 could see far over west and north for many
588,n06-119-02 miles. The real high country of the Rockies
588,n06-119-03 lifted up in the distance like a pale water-
588,n06-119-04 colour drawing. Between us and that lay
588,n06-119-05 a vast stretch of hills, canyons, buttes and
588,n06-119-06 malpais.
588,n06-123-00 "The mine-workings lie north of the town,"
588,n06-123-01 said Dan. "If we head west we ought to
588,n06-123-02 cut the trail leading from Gilburg to the north."
588,n06-123-03 So we swung west, making slow going over
588,n06-123-04 rough country, sliding on shale, climbing down
588,n06-123-05 into draws, circling a big mesa by a
588,n06-123-06 four or five mile valley, sandy-floored. It
588,n06-123-07 got hotter as the day wore on and we rested
588,n06-123-08 gratefully by a small creek where we watered
588,n06-123-09 the horses and drank enough to cure our
588,n06-123-10 thirst.
588,n06-128-00 An hour's riding brought us to a trail that
588,n06-128-01 we figured would lead to the miners' camp.
588,n06-128-02 We turned north into it and after about four
588,n06-128-03 miles it led into a small canyon which
588,n06-128-04 opened out into a wide shallow draw.
588,n06-128-05 Here in a dried-up creek-bed we found
588,n06-128-06 the miners at work. They were scattered
588,n06-128-07 over a fairly wide area working singly or
588,n06-128-08 in pairs.
588,n06-133-00 We didn't approach unchallenged. Just short
588,n06-133-01 of the diggings there was a roughly-built
588,n06-133-02 shack and as we got near someone inside bawled
588,n06-133-03 out, "If you come any closer, I'll sure blow
588,n06-133-04 your whiskers off." "Take it easy, mister," I sang
588,n06-133-05 out. "We don't aim to come any closer and we've
588,n06-133-06 got no whiskers so as you can see. Just you
588,n06-133-07 go and tell Nick Dowd we've come to talk
588,n06-133-08 to him about what happened last night."
588,n06-140-00 "Oh," said the unseen guard. He blew a
588,n06-140-01 whistle then, loud and shrill. The gun barrel
588,n06-140-02 peeking out through a hole in the shack never
588,n06-140-03 wavered. We sat our horses, waiting. "Looks as
588,n06-140-04 though they're expecting trouble," I said. "Where
588,n06-140-05 there's gold and women there's always trouble,"
588,n06-140-06 observed Dan, shifting about in his saddle. He
588,n06-140-07 was never long on patience.
589,p01-147-00 Mr. Copthorne knew a way round by the side
589,p01-147-01 of the church where there was a small open
589,p01-147-02 outbuilding where the grave digger kept his spades
589,p01-147-03 and forks and tidying up implements. It might
589,p01-147-04 be open. It was. He entered, and seated himself
589,p01-147-05 in a huddle upon an upturned wheelbarrow.
589,p01-147-06 His curious headgear fell off. Strange things
589,p01-147-07 were going on in his bewildered brain. When
589,p01-147-08 a man was drowning and towards his last
589,p01-147-09 gasp it was scientifically supposed his whole
589,p01-147-10 life came up before him in some cinematic
589,p01-147-11 kind of sequence.
590,p01-155-00 Mr. Copthorne was on dry land in a church
590,p01-155-01 outbuilding, but this was happening to him now. He
590,p01-155-02 saw himself as a sulky, ugly, malformed, repressed
590,p01-155-03 boy, then a young youth. He saw himself refusing
590,p01-155-04 baptism according to the sect his parents belonged to.
590,p01-155-05 Walking out of the chapel later on. Continuing
590,p01-155-06 on, his leaping mind flashed pictures of chi-
590,p01-155-07 canery and corruption, the growth of the dea-
590,p01-155-08 dly decadence and absorption in debase-
590,p01-155-09 ment and Satanic debauchery.
591,p01-168-00 He didn't know what to make of it, but it
591,p01-168-01 was Mr. Copthorne all right. Perhaps he had
591,p01-168-02 been attending some kind of fancy dress do
591,p01-168-03 in London. Very strange his eyes looked. Mad,
591,p01-168-04 hunted eyes, as if the poor fellow had rocks in
591,p01-168-05 his head, so the verger described afterwards.
591,p01-168-06 "You're very early about, sir," he said, trying to
591,p01-168-07 speak normally.
592,p01-174-00 "Yes. I travelled down from London
592,p01-174-01 as the dawn was breaking, and
592,p01-174-02 the thought came to me I'd like
592,p01-174-03 to take a look at the church. I've
592,p01-174-04 never been inside. Very remiss of
592,p01-174-05 me," said Mr. Copthorne. The verger
592,p01-174-06 led the way in. "The stained glass
592,p01-174-07 windows, sir, they date back to
592,p01-174-08 the fourteenth century."
593,p02-000-00 There were few passengers on the plane and Gavin was
593,p02-000-01 quickly through the customs. "Gay!" "Gavin!" The girl
593,p02-000-02 and her luggage had disappeared and they were alone
593,p02-000-03 together. The porter brought Gavin's bag out to the
593,p02-000-04 taxi. "Just a moment, darling," Gavin pressed her
593,p02-000-05 hand and smiled. "I want to check up on the
593,p02-000-06 flights back."
594,p02-008-00 Gay went out to the waiting
594,p02-008-01 taxi, and then found that in
594,p02-008-02 the excitement of meeting
594,p02-008-03 Gavin she had left her sun-
594,p02-008-04 glasses on the veranda. She
594,p02-008-05 went quickly back to fetch them.
594,p02-008-06 Gavin and the girl who had got
594,p02-008-07 off the plane with him were talking.
594,p02-008-08 He was writing something in his
594,p02-008-09 pocket-book, with a sick feeling
594,p02-008-10 of despair Gay knew that of course
596,p02-022-00 "And then we'll go for a stroll along the
596,p02-022-01 beach. A moon like this mustn't be wasted."
596,p02-022-02 He gestured towards the bay where the full
596,p02-022-03 moon was just rising over the rocks, then
596,p02-022-04 laid his hand on hers. Gay smiled at him
596,p02-022-05 again, happy beyond belief, knowing that
596,p02-022-06 now Gavin was in love with her and her
596,p02-022-07 only, yet remembering for a second the
596,p02-022-08 kisses she had seen him giving Elaine.
597,p02-027-00 All that was part of the past, she would put it behind her. She
597,p02-027-01 would never be jealous again, would even take Larry's advice and
597,p02-027-02 look the other way if need be. "I say!" Gavin was looking over her
597,p02-027-03 shoulder. "That's a pretty girl!" Gay glanced behind her, "Isn't she
597,p02-027-04 lovely, she's French, a very well known model I believe.
598,p02-069-00 Gay, a little puzzled, went through
598,p02-069-01 to the bar. Doc and Lilyan were
598,p02-069-02 sitting just inside having coffee.
598,p02-069-03 "Come and join us and bring your
598,p02-069-04 boy friend," Doc called. "No, Doc!"
598,p02-069-05 Lilyan remonstrated. "They want to be
598,p02-069-06 alone." "I've booked a table at the
598,p02-069-07 cafe*?2," Doc said, "they are packed
598,p02-069-08 tonight so come and join us if you
598,p02-069-09 can't find a table for two."
599,p02-076-00 Gay thanked him and walked out on to
599,p02-076-01 the terrace thinking that perhaps Gavin
599,p02-076-02 had bought a drink and taken it outside.
599,p02-076-03 She looked round scanning the tables,
599,p02-076-04 then caught her breath, a cold hand
599,p02-076-05 seeming to clutch her heart. Gavin was
599,p02-076-06 seated at a small table in a shadowy
599,p02-076-07 corner talking animatedly to Simone.
599,p02-076-08 As Gay watched he offered the girl a
599,p02-076-09 cigarette and lit it, his hands cupping
599,p02-076-10 hers in an intimate way.
599,p02-081-00 Gay stood irresolute for a moment, half
599,p02-081-01 decided to go back and join Lilyan and
599,p02-081-02 Doc, while she wanted to do no more than
599,p02-081-03 run upstairs to her room, knowing that
599,p02-081-04 Gavin although he had told her that he
599,p02-081-05 loved her, was already flirting with a girl
599,p02-081-06 that he had only met a few minutes before.
599,p02-081-07 Larry's advice flashed through her mind,
599,p02-081-08 but she turned away, giving a little
599,p02-081-09 gesture of hopelessness, knowing that her
598,p02-090-00 The others were all dancing and
598,p02-090-01 as Gay drew out a chair and sat
598,p02-090-02 down Gavin, without a word, swept
598,p02-090-03 Simone on to the floor. "It doesn't mean
598,p02-090-04 anything," Gay told herself desperately,
598,p02-090-05 trying to understand Gavin's point of
598,p02-090-06 view and remembering the advice
598,p02-090-07 that Larry had given her, while she
598,p02-090-08 felt wretched beyond words.
600,p02-101-00 His behaviour was not only boorish and in the worst of
600,p02-101-01 taste but it was unkind beyond words. She fumbled
600,p02-101-02 with the cigarette packet which lay on the table
600,p02-101-03 not wanting to smoke but needing some action
600,p02-101-04 to help her control her feelings. "Come and
600,p02-101-05 dance," Doc's cheery voice came as a
600,p02-101-06 lifeline and Gay got up quickly, mana-
600,p02-101-07 ging a smile.
601,p02-105-00 As he swung her on to the floor Gay saw Gavin
601,p02-105-01 and Simone go through the doorway that led
601,p02-105-02 down to the beach. Gay closed her eyes for a
601,p02-105-03 moment in disgust. She was fully aware that Gavin
601,p02-105-04 would make love to the French girl on the sands,
601,p02-105-05 and no doubt he would come back soon and
601,p02-105-06 after Simone had left expect her to accept his
601,p02-105-07 kisses on the way back to the hotel.

602,p02-109-01 "And that's the man whom you have been eating your
602,p02-109-03 heart out over?" Doc nodded towards the door. "You
602,p02-109-04 may consider him a man, I would say he was a
602,p02-109-05 mentally adolescent cad." "Oh, Doc ..." Gay protested
602,p02-109-06 weakly, "you don't know Gavin." "I've only met him
602,p02-109-07 today but I think I can safely say that I know
602,p02-109-08 him a great deal better than you do."
603,p02-115-00 Doc gave her hand a shake. "Wake up
603,p02-115-01 Gay, and don't even contemplate throwing
603,p02-115-02 yourself away on a chap like that. You're a
603,p02-115-03 fine girl, intelligent, and pretty, and I had
603,p02-115-04 thought you were sensible too. Don't
603,p02-115-05 make a fool of yourself over someone
603,p02-115-06 who doesn't care two jots for your feelings.
603,p02-115-07 If he behaves like this now what is your
603,p02-115-08 married life going to be like?
607,p02-135-00 Doc asked Lilyan to dance and once
607,p02-135-01 again Gay found herself alone at the table
607,p02-135-02 feeling self-conscious and awkward, sure that
607,p02-135-03 people were talking about the way Gavin
607,p02-135-04 was behaving since they had seen them
607,p02-135-05 dining together. She opened her bag
607,p02-135-06 to get out her compact and saw Grace's
607,p02-135-07 letter. She drew it out and opened it,
607,p02-135-08 glad to be able to occupy herself.
608,p02-139-00 "So glad that you are having such a lovely time, dearie,"
608,p02-139-01 it ran. "Your cards are lovely. I rang up Miss Harland
608,p02-139-02 and have been over to sit with her father and do what
608,p02-139-03 I can for him so that she can get out to do her shopping.
608,p02-139-04 He's getting on well but is pretty helpless still with his
608,p02-139-05 broken arm.
609,p02-144-00 No other news except that Elaine is engaged
609,p02-144-01 and going to marry a foreigner ..."
609,p02-144-02 Gay read the rest of the letter then put
609,p02-144-03 it back in her bag. Elaine was engaged,
609,p02-144-04 to the man she had spent so much time
609,p02-144-05 with at her party. That was why
609,p02-144-06 Gavin had come back to her.
609,p02-144-07 Everything was quite clear now, and to
609,p02-144-08 her own surprise Gay felt no heartbreak,
609,p02-144-09 rather a sense of relief now that she
609,p02-144-10 knew why Gavin had come to see
609,p02-144-11 her.
610,p02-150-00 Because she was second best. The others came back
610,p02-150-01 to the table, all of them making a fuss of her and at once
610,p02-150-02 she felt happier. Gay loved them for their warm sympathy,
610,p02-150-03 knowing that they were real friends, even if they were new ones.
610,p02-150-04 "That is a pretty dress," Lilyan commented, obviously sensing
610,p02-150-05 Gay's distress and in a way that Doc, as a man, could not
610,p02-150-06 understand, knowing that Gay was as much ashamed
610,p02-150-07 for Gavin at the way he was behaving as she
610,p02-150-08 was hurt for herself.
614,p03-012-00 "There are all sorts of wonder-
614,p03-012-01 ful jobs in London and I could
614,p03-012-02 take my pick, whereas in Yarmouth
614,p03-012-03 one has to know something about fishing
614,p03-012-04 and in Liverpool they'd want sea-farers.
614,p03-012-05 I don't think I'd go to Edinburgh un-
614,p03-012-06 less I was a Scot and wanting to get
614,p03-012-07 home, or perhaps a student studying to
614,p03-012-08 be a doctor, and I already know
614,p03-012-09 all about that."
615,p03-023-00 She was engaged to Nigel, had been for two years.
615,p03-023-01 Sometimes they talked on the theme of "when we get married",
615,p03-023-02 and then all was wonderful, and perhaps it had only been
615,p03-023-03 a slip of the tongue when Nigel had said, only last
615,p03-023-04 evening, "If we get married, old girl, you'll have to stop
615,p03-023-05 that lark, I can tell you!"
616,p03-027-00 She couldn't remember what they had been talking about or
616,p03-027-01 which 'lark' she would have to stop, only that significant tiny
616,p03-027-02 word shouted into her very soul a horn of warning, and
616,p03-027-03 with it was coupled a disembodied fragment of information,
616,p03-027-04 which now took on an ominous significance: Nigel had been
616,p03-027-05 seen in Farlingham on an occasion he had sworn he had
616,p03-027-06 been standing in for Luke Parsons at his surgery in
616,p03-027-07 Little Phelpham.
617,p03-029-00 Now Nigel had every right to go where he
617,p03-029-01 liked during his off-duty periods
617,p03-029-02 when she was not free; this much they had
617,p03-029-03 conceded one to the other. They rarely
617,p03-029-04 found they were off duty together, and
617,p03-029-05 the situation would have been intolerable
617,p03-029-06 had there not been some give and take
617,p03-029-07 about their relationship. So when Nigel
617,p03-029-08 had told her about taking Luke's
617,p03-029-09 evening surgery she had said,
618,p03-033-00 "Bless you! I hope Luke is suitably grateful, darling." "Oh, well,"
618,p03-033-01 he shrugged diffidently, "I like the work. One gets plenty
618,p03-033-02 of variety and it's a change." Nigel was the hospital's
618,p03-033-03 Junior Medical Officer. "You won't be free about nine, I
618,p03-033-04 suppose, to meet me for supper somewhere?" she had
618,p03-033-05 asked hopefully.
619,p03-040-00 "Hardly likely, my sweet. Luke's surgery goes on for
619,p03-040-01 hours. If they get in before eight-thirty, even
619,p03-040-02 though they're standing on one another's toes,
619,p03-040-03 I've got to see 'em. If I am free, though,
619,p03-040-04 I'll give you a ring, O.K.?" O.K.," she had
619,p03-040-05 replied readily. So how could Nigel have
619,p03-040-06 been at the Load of Trouble roadhouse,
619,p03-040-07 dancing with a blonde at eight-thirty that
619,p03-040-08 very evening?
620,p03-047-00 "No," she told Phil Gubbins, a junior
620,p03-047-01 houseman, "it wasn't Nigel you saw,
620,p03-047-02 my lad." "It was Nigel's car, anyway.
620,p03-047-03 NUF 121." "He probably loaned his car
620,p03-047-04 to somebody, Phil. He's always doing that."
620,p03-047-05 Young Gubbins shrugged. "I didn't see his
620,p03-047-06 face, Di, but it certainly looked like
620,p03-047-07 Nigel from the back. D.j. and all.
620,p03-047-08 Of course such as I couldn't afford
620,p03-047-09 to go into the Load of Trouble."
622,p03-072-00 "5Ye-es?" he lowered his eyes and kissed her on the
622,p03-072-01 mouth, an act of devotion he didn't over-indulge.
622,p03-072-02 "What about it, my sweet?" "Well," she laughed
622,p03-072-03 suddenly in an upsurging of relief, "that stupid
622,p03-072-04 Gubbins boy thought he saw you at the Load of Trouble.
622,p03-072-05 With a blonde, too. Imagine!" Nigel was frowning. He
622,p03-072-06 looked distinguished when he frowned; boyishly
622,p03-072-07 handsome at other times.
623,p03-080-00 "Gubbins? Gubbins?" he fretted. "Who's he?"
623,p03-080-01 Though Diana knew the name of every
623,p03-080-02 member of the staff, distinguished or not,
623,p03-080-03 Nigel often had to think hard to sort
623,p03-080-04 them out. "He's the carrotty lad, isn't he?"
623,p03-080-05 he now demanded. "What was he
623,p03-080-06 doing at the Load of Trouble?"
629,p03-163-00 "But I want it!" she protested. "It's my ring."
629,p03-163-01 "You just gave it back to me." "I
629,p03-163-02 didn't! I was joking. You know I was
629,p03-163-03 joking, Nigel." "You shouldn't joke
629,p03-163-04 about serious things like engagements."
629,p03-163-05 "Don't be such a baby!" They were going
629,p03-163-06 to have an open quarrel
629,p03-163-07 any minute, and she knew it.
630,p03-173-00 Almost in desperation she appealed, "Will you meet
630,p03-173-01 me at the gate, four o'clock tomorrow?" "Why?" he
630,p03-173-02 enquired, combing his thick, tawny hair. "To bring
630,p03-173-03 me up for tea, of course. I just thought." "I'll see,"
630,p03-173-04 he told her, and suddenly seized her in an embrace
630,p03-173-05 which really hurt. "Without your ring it's just like
630,p03-173-06 kissing somebody else's girl," he decided wickedly,
630,p03-173-07 and kissed her again, somewhat startled to
630,p03-173-08 receive a sharp slap for his pains.
631,p03-181-00 "If I were somebody else's girl that's
631,p03-181-01 what you'd get," she flashed at him, and
631,p03-181-02 so had left him, on her dignity and not
631,p03-181-03 seeing the look of admiration and revelation
631,p03-181-04 which had followed her slim young figure
631,p03-181-05 out of his sight. "Mine," Nigel Lester had
631,p03-181-06 decided with a sigh of satisfaction, and
631,p03-181-07 then regarded the ring which he retrieved
631,p03-181-08 from his pocket. "At a price," he concluded,
631,p03-181-09 with some bitterness.

633,p03-189-01 They often had such a rendezvous, for
633,p03-189-02 there was just time to smoke a cigarette,
633,p03-189-03 if one walked slowly, between road and
633,p03-189-04 hospital.
634,p06-030-00 His mouth hardened, his eyes became
634,p06-030-01 steely. 'I see.' Scorn lashed his
634,p06-030-02 words. 'I wonder you dared trust
634,p06-030-03 him to my care.' 'Nicholas -'
634,p06-030-04 'Well! At least I know the truth.
634,p06-030-05 Truth!' His gaze held hers
634,p06-030-06 masterfully. 'You wanted it so
634,p06-030-07 badly - at any price. I hope
634,p06-030-08 you are satisfied.'
634,p06-042-00 And as he spoke, the thought
634,p06-042-01 of Philip lying in the other
634,p06-042-02 room filled him with a re-
634,p06-042-03 vulsion that was homicidal.
634,p06-042-04 Even in that, his hands were
634,p06-042-05 tied. He dare not precipitate
634,p06-042-06 what might well be another
634,p06-042-07 coronary. And in that second
634,p06-042-08 he put back his professional
634,p06-042-09 mantle, and said with such
634,p06-042-10 icy politeness, such withdrawn
634,p06-047-00 'I will leave you the necessary pre-
634,p06-047-01 scription for the sedatives. You
634,p06-047-02 will contact your new doctor
634,p06-047-03 when you reach your parents'
634,p06-047-04 house.' She watched him flick
634,p06-047-05 his fountain-pen from his
634,p06-047-06 waistcoat pocket, take out
634,p06-047-07 his # prescription pad, and
634,p06-047-08 # scribble on it. Then,
634,p06-047-09 with a gesture she knew so well,
634,p06-047-10 he tore off the leaflet and
634,p06-052-00 'Good-bye, Sandra,' he said
634,p06-052-01 with a deadly finality. Watching
634,p06-052-02 him go, unable to speak, she
634,p06-052-03 felt that part of her was leaving
634,p06-052-04 him. She couldn't hate him...
634,p06-052-05 If only he would have con-
634,p06-052-06 fided in her, given some expla-
634,p06-052-07 nation. Now there was no-
634,p06-052-08 thing - not even friendship.
634,p06-058-00 She went back to Philip. But
634,p06-058-01 all she could hear were Nicholas's
634,p06-058-02 words: 'I love you - oh, you
634,p06-058-03 know that well enough.'
634,p06-058-04 Love. She revolted against
634,p06-058-05 the word. Nicholas, Philip...
634,p06-058-06 where was happiness, or
634,p06-058-07 peace of mind? Philip put out
634,p06-058-08 a hand and grasped hers.
634,p06-058-09 He needed her. She would find
634,p06-058-10 solace in that fact at least.
634,p06-069-00 She had her truth. How much had built
634,p06-069-01 up from that first ideal, and how
634,p06-069-02 little joy, or satisfaction, it had
634,p06-069-03 given her. 'I'm sorry, darling.'
634,p06-069-04 He looked nervous. It had been
634,p06-069-05 hell lying there, knowing she was
634,p06-069-06 talking to Nicholas and wondering
634,p06-069-07 what they were saying. Sandra
634,p06-069-08 said instinctively: 'I told him
634,p06-069-09 I knew he was responsible for
634,p06-069-10 Beryl's death.'
634,p06-088-00 Her eyes darkened in torment. 'Are
634,p06-088-01 you sure that she was telling the truth?'
634,p06-088-02 'Good heavens, darling, why on earth
634,p06-088-03 should she lie? Besides, it wasn't just
634,p06-088-04 her word. There was enough evidence,
634,p06-088-05 no matter how one might want to
634,p06-088-06 disbelieve the facts.' Elation
634,p06-088-07 touched him after the cold wind
634,p06-088-08 of suspense. 'It will be interesting
634,p06-088-09 to see what comes out at the inquest.
634,p06-096-00 What his story will be. I reckon
634,p06-096-01 he'll confine himself to the nervous
634,p06-096-02 origin of her recent illness. His notes
634,p06-096-03 will be truthful, but what he leaves out
634,p06-096-04 will matter most.' Strange how just
634,p06-096-05 then Philip was so certain that Nicholas
634,p06-096-06 would never betray him. He loved
634,p06-096-07 Sandra too deeply to ruin her
634,p06-096-08 future happiness. Had ever circum-
634,p06-096-09 stances conspired so cunningly?
634,p06-096-10 Philip's spirits soared.
634,p06-104-00 He was better; he had made a
634,p06-104-01 miraculous recovery and Sandra would
634,p06-104-02 soon be his wife. The Devil, he thought,
634,p06-104-03 certainly looked after his own.
634,p06-104-04 Something in Sandra's attitude struck
634,p06-104-05 him suddenly, making him say:
634,p06-104-06 'You can't forgive him for this -
634,p06-104-07 can you?' 'Forgive is an unctuous,
634,p06-104-08 patronizing word,' she replied. 'I despise
634,p06-104-09 the deceit. The lies.'
315,r03-053-00 His voice was like his black and pin-stripe,
315,r03-053-01 a grey superimposition of respectability over
315,r03-053-02 the original colour of his own natural vowels,
315,r03-053-03 the result being somehow as ineffective, not
315,r03-053-04 just dusty-grey but muddy, slimy even.
315,r03-053-05 His digressions too, seemed to have no other
315,r03-053-06 purpose than the throwing of dust in his
315,r03-053-07 client's eyes, the dust of fake security, of
315,r03-053-08 the fake friend of the family, like the
